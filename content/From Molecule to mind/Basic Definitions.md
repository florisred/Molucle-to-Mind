1. *Pre-synaptic*: the synapse that transmit signals from the 'upstream' neuron
2. *Post-synaptic*: the synapse that transmit signals from the 'downstream' neuron
- *Gap Junction*: membranes of the two communicating neurons come extremely close to one another and are linked together --> electrical synapses
	- They contain a very specific kind of electricity channel, a *connexon* 
- *Synaptic cleft*: like a gap junction but with chemical channels, further apart
- *Synaptic vesicles*: small organelles containing *neurotransmitters*
