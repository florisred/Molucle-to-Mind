## ATP (and other purines)
- all vesicles contain it, and is released together with classic neurotransmitters
	- Is it then a co-transmitter?
	- YES! together with the other purines. What a surprise.
- ATP acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter in motor neurons and the ganglia
- ATP is degraded to Adenosine (can also act as a co-transmitter)
- ATP and adenosine receptors are all over the nervous system
- Different classes of receptors:
### P2X receptors
- Structure is unique among ionotropic receptors
	- each subunit has a transmembrane domain that crosses the membrane only twice
	- Still form a pore in the middle though, like the others
- Prevalent in CNS and PNS
