# The final explanation of the Action potential:
## inside the cell
- The increase in Na+ conductance causes Na+ to enter the neuron.
	- This depolarizes the membrane potential, approaching E<sub>Na</sub>.
- The rate of depolarization falls due to the decrease in the electrochemical driving force on Na+ and the inactivation of Na+ conductance.
- At the same time, depolarization activates the voltage-dependent K+ conductance, causing K+ to leave the cell and repolarize the membrane potential toward E<sub>K</sub>.
- The K+ conductance becomes temporarily higher than in the resting condition, causing the membrane potential to briefly become more negative than the normal resting potential, resulting in the undershoot.
	- The hyperpolarization of the membrane potential causes the voltage-dependent K+ conductance (and any Na+ conductance not inactivated) to turn off, allowing the membrane potential to return to its resting level.
## Outside the cell --> long distance communication
- Recall, axons are a bad conductor
- So, AP's are used.
	- A *depolarizing stimulus* enters flows into a neuron --> causes it to depolarize
		- AP Happens
	- Some of that current will flow passively down the axon
	- The ions do not flow, but charge does. 
		- This passive current flow depolarizes the membrane potential in the adjacent region of the axon, thus opening the Na+ channels in the neighboring membrane, passing along the action potential.
- The refractory period makes it harder for a subsequent AP to form --> makes sure that the AP is not being propagated backward. 
	- Also limits the amount per second the neuron can transport an AP, depending on the densities of the [[Ion channels]]. 
- The *conductance velocity* is not very high, therefore the axons are often [[Myelination|myelinated]]
