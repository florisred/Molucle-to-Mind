## Peptide neurotransmitters
- Many peptides also act as neurotransmitters
	- Often involved in emotion regulation, pain perception, or stress responses
- They are fundamentally different from *small-molecule* transmitters
- Normally synthesized much more large than a mature peptide
	- these are *pre-propeptides*
	- in the rough endoplasmic reticulum where a *signal-sequence* is removed -> then becomes a *propeptide*
- Their activity depends on their amino acid sequence
- five categories:
	-  the brain/gut peptides;
	- opioid peptides; 
	- pituitary peptides; 
	- hypothalamic releasing hormones; 
	- a catch-all category containing others
- First discovered: *substance P*
	- Hypotensive agent
	- in hippocampus and guts and many other things
	- 11 amino acids long
	- Gene that codes for substance p also codes for other neuropeptides

### Opioid peptides
-  Called so because their receptors are activated by opium
- are often *analgesics*
- Discovered while looking for *endorphins* -> the natural substances that activate these receptors
	- We discovered more than 20, that fit in 3 classes
- Almost all work through [[G-protein]]
	- Require lower concentrations than normal neurotransmitters
- Are very addictive!
