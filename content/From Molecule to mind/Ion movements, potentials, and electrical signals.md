# Ion movements and electrical signals
- **Differences in concentrations of specific ions** cause electrical potentials between the inside and outside of the cell
	- These differences come about due to the *selective permeability* of nerve cells
	- This is done by [[active transporters]], proteins that move ions in- and out of the cell against concentration gradient
	- **Ion channels** allow for *passive diffusal* along the concentration gradient
- **Differences in electric charge** can also affect the balance. 
	- Negative ions want to go to a more positive location
- These two forces work against each other, such that a balance is created
	- This is called the *electrochemical equilibrium*
		1.  the concentration gradient that causes K+ to move from inside to outside, taking along positive charge
		2. an opposing electrical gradient that increasingly tends to stop K+ from moving across the membrane.
	- The number of ions per cm<sup>2</sup> is very small to create this current
# Equilibrium potential
- The potential reached at the electrochemical equilibrium is the *equilibrium potential* which can be calculated as the *Nernst Equation*

  ![[Pasted image 20240916151311.png|200]]
- E<sub>x</sub> is the equilibrium potential for ion X, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, z is the valence (electrical charge) of the permeant ion, and F is the faraday constant.
	- When concentration of K+ is higher inside than out, a negative potential is measured across a K+-permeable membrane
- In humans, this results in -58mV
## With one ion-type
- What would happen if the electrical potential if the potassium on the outside was replaced by sodium?
	- No potential generated, as no Na+  could flow across the membrane only permeable to K+.
	- However, if the membrane became only permeable to Na+, it would be a +58mV potential
- If it was Ca<sup>2+</sup>, it would be a +29mV potential, due to the higher valence
- If you apply a voltage to the original membrane of -58mV, the ion flow would stop. If you made it more negative, ions would flow the other way around. 
## With more than one ion type
- Lets say you have a distribution of
	- 10mMK+ and 1mMNa+ on the inside 
	- 1mMK+  and 10mMNa+ on the outside
- The membrane voltage would depend on the *relative permeability* of the membrane. If it lets through more Potassium, it would approach -58mV, and vice versa. 
- This creates the need for another equation, the *Goldman Equation*.![[Pasted image 20240916152743.png|300]]
	- z (valence) has been removed! 
		- Concentration of negatively charged chloride ions have been reversed --> look at the out/in
## [[Action potentials]] and ions
- The membrane starts as being permeable to K+ and is then temporarily switched to become more permeable to Na+.
	- In this case, first the membrane is negative, but rapidly becomes more positive with the Na+ ions, and falls back again when the Na+ gates are closed. 
- There is always more K+ inside the cell than outside due to the *ion transporters*
	- Therefor, the resting potentials is **negative**
	- As the membrane potential is de-polarized (due to an action potential), more Na+ rushes in. --> positive feedback loop
	- this falls again when Na+ is no longer able to pass. 
- Changing the concentration of Na+ outside does not change the resting potential much, which means that the membrane is not very permeable for Na+ in resting state
	- This changes during the *Rising phase*, when it becomes very permeable to Na+
		- This stays the case until the *overshoot phase*
		- after the overshoot, the Na+ permeability is reduced and stopped, and K+ permeability is increased, causing the *undershoot phase*
# ionic basis of the resting potential
- This table shows the concentrations for mammals and squids![[Pasted image 20240916160021.png|300]]
- The concentrations are a lot lower in humans as the blood of squids normally holds many more ions --> is from the sea.
