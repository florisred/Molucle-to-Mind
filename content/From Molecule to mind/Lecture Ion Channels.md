# Chapter 2-4
- all neurons have a membrane potential that is lower than 0
- Researcher can manipulate current with electrodes
	- Eject current --> change in membrane potential that not completely follows the current
		- Its more slower (due to passive responses)
	- Active responses are action potentials
- this is due to [[ion channels]]
## Ligand-directed ion channels or voltage gated ion channels
- Ligand opens due to transmitters, and voltage ofc due to voltage
- channels are often specialized for specific ions and will only pass that one
## What is the little peak on the end of the graph?
- Bc the membrane is lipidic, the ions move along the membrane which creates a current when the signal is removed.
## Stochastism within ion channels
- Voltage gated ion channels never are 100% surely open or closed, but the chance that they are open depends on the voltage. Never goes to 1.
## Sodium (Na+) channel is open only shortly
![[Pasted image 20240915194529.png|300]]
- They start closing before resting potential is reached
	- They have to be depolarized before they can open again
- Potassium (K+) channels do not have this problem.
	- But do open slower
## What do they look like?

- 4 subunits
	- 6 transmembrane domains and 1 gate per unit
