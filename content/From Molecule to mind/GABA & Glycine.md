## GABA
- Most inhibitory synapses use *GABA* or *Glycine*
- *GABA*: Î³-aminobutyric acid 
- As many as 1/3 of all synapses use GABA
- Most commonly found in *local circuit interneurons* -> [[Neurons#Types of neurons|types of neurons]]
- Synthesized from *glucose*, then metabolized to *[[Glutamate]]* by enzymes
	- *GAD* (Glutamic acid decarboxylase) catalyzes glutamate to GABA reaction with *co-factor* pyridoxal phosphate
	- Once synthesized, transported in *VIAAT*
- Once in the synaptic cleft, removal is much like that of glutamate
	- Either in Glial cells or direct reuptake
	- GABA is converted to *succinate* or *y-hydroxybutyrate*
		- the latter is known as a date-rape drug
		- Due to more *inhibitory* behavior
- Activation of GABA receptors cause influx of Cl<sup>-</sup> 

### Types of GABA receptors
- GABA<sub>A</sub>
	- ionotropic --> allows Cl<sup>-</sup> to enter cell
- GABA<sub>B</sub>
	- Metabotropic --> activation of K<sup>+</sup> channels
### Drugs that interact with GABA
- Benzodiazepines such as *diazepam, Chlordiazepixide* reduce anxiety by binding to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors
- Ketamine too
- Many anesthetics --> inhibitory
- Ethanol

## Glycine
- Less prevalent than GABA
	- A lot in the spinal cord
- Uses the same mechanisms as GABA for transportation
- Mutations in the genes coding for some of these transporters cause *hyperglycinemia* ->lethargy, seizures, and mental retardation
