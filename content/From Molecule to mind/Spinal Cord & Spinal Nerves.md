# The peripheral nervous system
## Basics
- All neurons outside CNS
- Sensory neurons: body -> brain (afferent)
- motor neurons; brain-> body (efferent)
## PNS: autonomic vs somatic
 - Somatic = conscious action
 - autonomic = unconscious action (vital)
	 - Sympathetic vs parasympathetic
## Autonomic neuropathy
- Damage to autonomic nerves
- risk factors:
	- High blood glucose / diabetes
	- high cholesterol
	- smoking & alcohol
- Symptoms organ-bound
	- cardiovascular
	- digestive
	- sweat glands
# Spinal Cord
## Internal anatomy of the spinal cord
- Nerve tissue rich in nerve cell bodies and dendrites 
	- Gray matter (cell bodies) on the inside
	- White matter: on the outside
- The ratios of this differ along the spinal cord
### Gray matter
- Consists of three horn-like shapes
	- enables individuals to control movement, memory, and emotions
- Neurons receive sensory info via the dorsal roots
- Cell bodys of motor neurons that and at muscles via the ventral roots
- Motor neurons that project to the sympathetic ganglia -> only the *thoracic* region of the spinal cord
- Central canal is filled with central canal
### White matter
- Sends neural signals along the spinal cord
- lateral funiculus
	- axons that extend form the neurons to the ventral horns
- Dorsal funivuli -> carry ascending sensory info
## The spinal cord
 - long thin, and tubular structure of the nervous tissue
 - intermediary between cns and periphery
 - can be divided into 31 segments
	 - 8 cervical
	 - 12 thoracic
	- 5 lumbar
	- 5 sacral
	- 1 coccygeal
- Cervical enlargement: C5 -T1 --> upper limbs
- lumbar enlargement: L2 to S3 are for lower limbs
### Cross-section of the spinal cord
- you also have the dura, arachnoid, and pia.
### Lumbar puncture
- fetal position on the side --> spine opens up
- Needle between L3/L4, L4/L5, L5/S1
	- avoid damage to conus medullaris
### White matter tracts in the spinal cord
#### Motor and descending pathways (efferent)
- Corticospinal tract
	- originates in the cerebral cortex
	- crus cerebri through the midbrain and pons
	- medullary pyramids --> pyramiddal tract
	- 90% of the fibres decussate in lower medulla
	- 10% of fibres decussate in the spinal cord

#### Sensory and ascending (afferent) pathways
- Dorsal column medial lemniscus 
- Spinocerebellar tract
	- Unconscious action
- Spinothalamic tract
	- anterior spinothalamic tract: crude touch
	- Lateral spinothalamic tract: pain, temperature
	- Skin 
	- only one that decussates at the level of the spinal cord
		- Through the central part at the place of entering the spinal cord
- Dorsal column medial lemniscal pathway
	- Fine touch, proprioception, vibration
	- Dorsal root ganglion - dorsal column
	- Decussates in the medulla
### Brown-Sequard Syndrome
- Unilateral damage to the spinal cord --> half of the spinal cord
	- *Ipsilateral* paralysis below the lesion
	- *ipsilateral* loss of fine touch/ proprioception / vibration
	- *Contralateral* loss of pain / temperature perception
- This is due to the decussations
	- Decussation is **used in biological contexts to describe a crossing**
