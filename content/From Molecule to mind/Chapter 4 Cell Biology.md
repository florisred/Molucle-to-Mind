# Protein Structure and Function
- Proteins are the main building blocks from which cells are assembled, and they constitute most of the cell’s dry mass.
## The Shape and STrucTure of proteins
- From a chemical point of view, proteins are by far the most structurally complex and functionally sophisticated molecules known
	- To be expected after billions of years of evolution
### The Shape of a protein is Specified by its amino acid Sequence
- Proteins are made of bonds of [[20 different amino-acids]] held together by [[peptide bond]]
	- proteins thus are polypeptides made of [[polypeptide chains]]
		- Consists of polypeptide backbone (N-C-C) with side-chain bonds
			- Side-chains give protein its function
		- Has directionality (N-terminus and Carboxyl-terminus)
		- With a specific amino acid sequence
- These long peptide-chains are often flexible, but folded due to three interactions
	1. noncovalent bonds often [[Protein folding|fold]] the chain in a certain way
		- One bond is weak, but many do trick.
	2. [[Hydrophobic interaction]]
		- In an aqueous environment, hydrophobic molecules, including the nonpolar side chains of particular amino acids, tend to be forced together to minimize their disruptive effect on he hydrogen-bonded network of the surrounding water molecules
		-  Therefore, an important factor governing the folding of any protein is the distribution of its polar and nonpolar amino acids.
		- Hydrophobic (nonpolar) chains cluster (like oil droplets)
	3. Proteins fold into a conformation of Lowest energy
		- The final folded structure, or conformation, is generally the shape in which its free energy (G) is minimized. [[Example of this]]
- If the conditions change, a protein can [[denature]]. They can often regain their previous shape.
- If it folds incorrectly, a protein can often clump up and damage cells.
	- [[Alzheimer's Disease]] and amyloid beta, [[Huntington's Disease]]
	- Some diseases (mad cow disease) is caused by misfolded proteins called Prions
		- These prions damage other proteins, making them prions --> infectious
- [[Chaperone proteins]] often help folding proteins, but dont have effect on final shape
### proteins come in a Wide Variety of complicated Shapes
- the vast majority are between 50 and 2000 amino acids long
	- Some 30, some 10,000
	- [[Four different ways of viewing HPr protein]]
### Common folding patterns
- Although each protein is unique, some patterns can be detected.
#### The α helix and the β Sheet
- the α helix, was found in the protein α-keratin, which is abundant in skin and its derivatives—such as hair, nails, and horns.
- Within a year of the discovery of the α helix, a second folded structure, called a β sheet, was found in the protein fibroin, the major constituent of silk.
	-  β sheet is made when hydrogen bonds form between segments of a polypeptide chain that lie side by side (see Figure 4–13D). When the neighboring segments run in the same orientation (say, from the N-terminus to the C-terminus), the structure is a parallel β sheet; when they run in opposite directions, the structure is an antiparallel β sheet. Both types of β sheet produce a very rigid, pleated structure, and they form the core of many proteins. Even the small bacterial protein HPr.
4–12) contains several β sheets
- Helixes are to be expected, as they form from easily repeatable patterns on a straight line
	- Sometimes two (or three) α helices will wrap around one another to form a particularly stable structure known as a coiled-coil. This structure forms when the α helices have most of their nonpolar (hydrophobic) side chains on one side, so that they can twist around each other with these side chains facing inward—minimizing their contact with the aqueous cytosol 
### Proteins have Several Levels of organization
1. Primary structure: Ameno acid sequence
2. Secondary structure: α helix and β Sheet
3. Tertiary structure: he full, three-dimensional conformation formed by an entire polypeptide chain—including the α helices, β sheets, random coils, and any other loops and folds that form between the N- and C-termini
4. Quaternary structure,  the protein molecule is formed as a complex of more than one polypeptide chain
### Protein domain
- A protein domain is defined as any segment of a polypeptide chain that can fold independently into a compact, stable structure. 
	- Usually 40-350 amino acids
### Unstructured regions
- intrinsically disordered sequences often link the different protein domains together
	- Present estimates suggest that a third of all eukaryotic proteins have long unstructured regions in their polypeptide chain (greater than 30 amino acids in length), while a substantial number of eukaryotic proteins are mostly disordered under normal conditions
- Also have functions
	- Flexible --> can wrap around other proteins
	- Can provide flexibility to proteins, or other functions
### Protein families
- Some proteins are very stable throughout evolution, but some change a lot
	- Some proteins look very similar, despite having quite a different ameno-acid make-up and preferring different substrates.
### Protein binding
- Many big proteins consist of multiple polypeptide chains
- Are bound through noncovalent bonds
	- Creates quaternary structures
	- A Dimer is a protein made of two identical subproteines bound together
### Proteins can form filaments, sheets, or spheres
- Filament is usually many of the same protein connected identically, forming a strong line.
- This usually happens by itself. a cell is self-organizing: if the required proteins are produced in the right amounts, the appropriate structures will form automatically.
- [[Example subunit to different types of structures]]
- Elastin is formed by unstructured parts of a protein being able to stretch, allowing skin and lungs to have their elastic properties
### extracellular proteins are often Stabilized by covalent cross-Linkages
- Basically, proeins that largely live outside of the cell are often stabalized by covalent cross-linkages. These linkages can either tie together two amino acids in the same polypeptide chain or join together many polypeptide chains in a large protein complex
	- A common example is disulfide bonds, that  act as a sort of “atomic staple” to reinforce the protein’s most favored conformation. [[Covalent cross-linkages]]

Living cells contain an enormously diverse set of protein molecules,
each made as a linear chain of amino acids linked together by cova-
lent peptide bonds.
• Each type of protein has a unique amino acid sequence, which deter-
mines both its three-dimensional shape and its biological activity.
• The folded structure of a protein is stabilized by multiple noncovalent
interactions between different parts of the polypeptide chain.
• Hydrogen bonds between neighboring regions of the polypeptide
backbone often give rise to regular folding patterns, known as α heli-
ces and β sheets.
• The structure of many proteins can be subdivided into smaller globu-
lar regions of compact three-dimensional structure, known as protein
domains.
• The biological function of a protein depends on the detailed chemical
properties of its surface and how it binds to other molecules, called
ligands.
• When a protein catalyzes the formation or breakage of a specific
covalent bond in a ligand, the protein is called an enzyme and the
ligand is called a substrate.
• At the active site of an enzyme, the amino acid side chains of the
folded protein are precisely positioned so that they favor the for-
mation of the high-energy transition states that the substrates must
pass through to be converted to product.
• The three-dimensional structure of many proteins has evolved so
that the binding of a small ligand can induce a significant change in
protein shape.
• Most enzymes are allosteric proteins that can exist in two conforma-
tions that differ in catalytic activity, and the enzyme can be turned
on or off by ligands that bind to a distinct regulatory site to stabilize
either the active or the inactive conformation.
• The activities of most enzymes within the cell are strictly regulated.
One of the most common forms of regulation is feedback inhibition,
in which an enzyme early in a metabolic pathway is inhibited by the
binding of one of the pathway’s end products.
• Many thousands of proteins in a typical eukaryotic cell are regulated
by cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.
• GTP-binding proteins also regulate protein function in eukaryotes;
they act as molecular switches that are active when GTP is bound
and inactive when GDP is bound; turning themselves off by hydrolyz-
ing their bound GTP to GDP.
• Motor proteins produce directed movement in eukaryotic cells
through conformational changes linked to the hydrolysis of ATP to
ADP.
• Highly efficient protein machines are formed by assemblies of allos-
teric proteins in which the various conformational changes are
coordinated to perform complex functions.
• Covalent modifications added to a protein’s amino acid side chains
can control the location and function of the protein and can serve as
docking sites for other proteins.
• Starting from crude cell or tissue homogenates, individual proteins
can be obtained in pure form by using a series of chromatography
steps.
• The function of a purified protein can be discovered by biochemical
analyses, and its exact three-dimensional structure can be deter-
mined by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy
