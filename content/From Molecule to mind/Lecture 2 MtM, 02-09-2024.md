# Master of Neuroscience
## Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive research
- Has people from many different backgrounds --> helps with complex problems
- Mechanistic neuroscience research aiming to find *causality*
- Part of Amsterdam Neuroscience

## Models & Methodologies
### Model organisms
- Really useful
- We will start with yeast, but other, more complex animals follow each week.

# SynBio1: Synapse probability
## Learning goals (handy for exam)
- Four different types of synapses and their predicted reliability  
- Synaptic probability, synaptic failures  
- Short lived and long lived changes in synaptic probability
## Synapses
- Once an electrical signal arrives at a synapse, the signal is converted into a chemical signal
	- These chemicals are synthesized and stored in vesicle
	- This triggers a new electrical signal at receiving neuron
- Action potentials are surprisingly invariable (almost identical throughout entire brain)
	- However, the synapses are very modular and diverse
### Synapses fail, Synapse probability
- Many synapses fail upon single stimulation
	- Very often, there is no response from the next neuron (not as clean as in cartoons)
	- There is a specific probability that an action potential signal will be passed on to the next neuron ([[Release site synapse]])
		- A neuron might not have enough vesicles available for transmission
		- So, a synapse might have multiple release sites as compensation. 
			- Makes it unlikely that a synapse will fail
		- Some synapses *(Celix of Held)* have over 100 release sites 
			- This is an evolutionary synapse found from auditory to motor cortex (fight or flight system)
			- Or, for synapses between smelling food and salivating (built in, we are not a tabula rasa.)
			- In geese this is seen in the [[Tinbergen Experiment]]
		- Some have 2-10 sites (muscle neurons for example)
		- probably 90% only have one --> allow for probability.
			- This allows for an adaptive capacity of the brain
				- Everything is connected to everything in the brain
				- So, if it were not probabilistic your brain would be epileptic
				- Also allows for your brain to learn --> older, weak connections between neurons get stronger (synapses get stronger) through *coincidence detection*. 
					- Leads to biochemical changes that last a long time (such as salivate because of bell)
