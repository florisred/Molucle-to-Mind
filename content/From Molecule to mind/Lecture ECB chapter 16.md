## Modes of signaling
### Endocrine
- Hormonal
- Endocrine cell releases hormone in bloodstream  which reaches a distant cell receptors
- High affinity for molecules that need to be detected (only a little reaches cell due to diffusion)
### Paracrine
- *Local mediator* reaches target cell receptors in intracellular fluid (not blood) in nearby cells
### Neuronal
- Neuron transfers AP over a small distance (synapse)
### Contact-dependent signaling
- membrane-bound signal molecule (needs to touch other cell)
## Signaling pathways serve to integrate information into unique output
- different types of signal
	- For survival, to grow and divide, and sometimes even to differentiate.
	- If there are no signals, if they do not communicate, they become *apoptotic* and die. 
## Signaling occurs at different time scales
- Its not a linear path, but can have many different paths
- Some signaling molecules first have to be transcribed in DNA and RNA, so effect starts after minutes to hours 
	- Often used for complex tasks like differentiation
- Some signaling molecules directly affect protein function, which takes seconds.
## Signaling cascade
- signaling cell -> signal -> receptor -> receptor -> target molecule -> response
- After the signal is found, the signal will be *amplified* into smaller intracellular messaging proteins. This is done to ensure that the signal is not lost. 
- Signal integration: balance (possible contradicting) signals
	- For example, certain molecules have an effect on how GABA acts upon the cell
## Types of receptors
### Ligand-gated ion channels
- Before we actually knew how it worked, we already tested the different types of receptors
	- We just added glutamate to cells and saw it change potential -> derive that they exist
- GABA receptors consist of many different subunits which react slightly differently
	- Not all subunits can be combined --> they are not friends in the *ER*
- Often work in about milliseconds

### G-protein coupled receptors
#### Receptor
 - c terminus in cytoplasm, N terminus outside of cell
 - permeates the membrane about 7 times
 - Signaling molecule activates it, and it will get an affinity for the alpha subunit
![[Pasted image 20240912102856.png|500]]
#### G-Protein 
- Has different subunits
	- alpha: GDP / GTP binding
		- When it binds with an active receptor, GDP is replaced with GTP an 
		- Now, the the Beta-gamma complex start floating in membrane and activate signals
			- ion channels for example
		- GTP can be converted with hydrolysis -> phosphate is released
			- Done by phosphatase (enzime)
	- Gamma
	- These two have lipid anchor in membrane
	- Also has Beta subunit
- These will diffuse along the cell membrane --> concentration there stays high
#### Second messenger
- Cyclic AMP
	- Forms from ATP when it reaches an adenylyl cyclase activated by activated G-protein
	- cAMP makes [[Second messengers#cAMP-dependent protein kinase -> PKA|PKA]] and activates cyclic nucleotide 
- Same happens with GTP to GMP
	- Done by guanylyl which 
- **Important**: G-protein activates other structures which then amplify the signal, which can amplify the signal again
#### Amplification
- Receptor  ***--->*** G-protein -> adenylyl cyclase ***--->*** cyclic AMP -> Protein kinases **--->** phosphates transferred to target proteins
- Green and bold arrows amplify the signal, bc one receptor interaction creates an opportunity to create many signal molecules

#### Neuronal second messenger -> Ca<sup>2+</sup>
- Ca<sup>2+</sup> can interact with two negatively charged amino acids -> bend proteins -> activate / inactivate proteins
	- therefore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations should remain low. 
	- You need a signal to release it
### Intracellular receptors
- (Often hydrophobic) signal molecules that go directly into cells
	- Hydrophobic because it needs to penetrate the *cell membrane*
## Phosphorylation signaling, two modes:
![[Pasted image 20241014233120.png]]
## Protein Kinase A
- Inactive state:
	 - Catalytic Domains 
	 - Regulatory domain is folded, blocking the catalytic domain
- Active state
	- When cAMP binds to the regulatory domain, it unfolds
	- Catalytic domains are then active
![[Pasted image 20241014232953.png]]
## CAM-kinase activation
- Ca<sup>2+</sup> / CaM binds to the regulatory site, unfolding it and freeing the catalytic domain
## Mechanism of protein kinase C  (PKC)
- DAG(*Diacylglycerol*), Ca<sup>2+</sup>, PS(unimportant) binds to regulatory domains which unfolds the protein
	- has *multiple signals*
## Signaling via tyrosine kinase receptors
### Activation
- Inactive RKT is sitting in the membrane
- signal molecule in form of a dimer binds to two inactive RKT 
	- Activates the tyrosine kinase domain
	- When you bring them together, they phosphorylate each other
![[Pasted image 20241014233030.png]]
### How is the signal relayed?
- Activated protein binds to the phosphorylated RTK
- Example: MAP [[kinase]]
	- activated Ras protein binds to RTK
		- Activated MAP kinase kinase binds to activated Ras protein
		- That activates MAP kinase kinase
		- That activates Activated MAP kinase
		- That phosphorylates proteins and transcription regulators
	- All of the activation is done by ATP conversion to ADP, leaving one phosphate group to bind to the enzyme or protein
- This is very complicated, and very obtuse --> signal specificity
	- This is only one *adaptor protein*, but there are **6**
