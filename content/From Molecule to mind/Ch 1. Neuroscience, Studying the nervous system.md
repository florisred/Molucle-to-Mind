# Overview
- Neuroscience encompasses a broad range of questions about the brains of humans and other animals
- Studied in a multimodal way
	- The biggest challenge is integrating these different disciplines
- Mostly about how neurons and glia perform functions
	- These make [[neural circuits]]
	- These are in turn used for three different purposes
		1. sensory systems -> report state of organism
		2. motor systems -> generate movement
		3. association systems -> higher order brain functions
			- perception, attention, memory, emotions, language, and thinking, all of which fall under the rubric of cognition
