## Aspects:
- Immediate memory
- Working memory
- Long-term memory

## Memory & molecular mechanisms
- For long term memory you need the entire brain
	- Widespread projections from association neocortex converge on the hippocampal region
	- The output off the hippocampus is ultimately directed back to these  same neocortical areas
## Long-term potentiation in hippocampus
- CA3 pyramidal cells and CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus
	- In the middle there are *Schaffer collaterals*
- High-frequency stimulation promotes LTP (*long term potentiation*)
	- higher [[EPSP, IPSP, and potential summation#Excitatory and Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials|EPSP]] amplitude during and after high frequency stimu
	- can take up to a year
	- ![[Pasted image 20241002122510.png]]
	- Here, synapse 2 will also be depolarized during strong simulation
		- This will cause *association* -> also strengthening pathway 2
- How does it work molecularly?
	- Due to receptors *AMPA* and *NMDA*
	- at resting potential:
		- NDMA receptor is blocked bc there is a magnesium ion in the channel. --> does not conduct ions
		- AMPA will be open
	- During depolarization:
		- Magnesium is expelled due to positive charge
		- Channel opens, Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>
	- This calcium and Sodium then causes in a long way more AMPA receptors to be placed in the membrane. 
	- Must happen in 6h, as after that the channels are already in place.
- Camkinase (*CaMKII*) regulates all of this
	- Calcium that enters the NMDA receptors binds to calmodulin, which in turn activates CaMKII.
	- Can autophosphorylate itself, therefore staying active for a very long time (about an hour)
	- Then it can phosphorylate AMPA receptors or associated proteins, causing *LTP*
	- CaMKII also contributes to structural changes in the synapse, promoting the growth of dendritic spines, which helps maintain the synaptic strength over time.
		- For example, you find a lot of CaMKII in the post-synaptic density. 
		- It *translocates* --> [[figure camkinase translocation]]
