## RNA from DNA (transcription)
- When you make RNA from DNA, the double stranded helix is opened and read, and then single-strand RNA is created
	- The DNA gene has to be open, and different cells have different 3D DNA organization, so different gene expression
- Where does this happen? At the start site of the gene
	- Sigma factor recognizes the promotor of the gene
- I think you read from 
- When making RNA you needÂ  a capping factor, splicing factor, and polyadenylation factors
	- These proteins are in the cytoplasm, and attach as it is generated
		- First binds capping factor --> necessary for export into the cytoplasm
		- At the end there are about 150-200 A's, to protect the RNA from being degraded
	- Immature mRNA reads the entire gene, and then the intron is cut out of the mRNA.
		- The intron sequence is than turned into a circular lariat
	- Depending on the different splicing factors that cut out different exons are in the mRNA, the same gene can code for multiple proteins --> humans have this more than other animals!!
- If cap binding protein, EJC, and AAA sequence it leaves the nucleus for translation

## Small insertions can lead to big problems
- If there is a small insertion of 1, 2 or 4 aminoacids, you *shift* the aminoacids which can be very detrimental
## How to make a protein from a messenger RNA
- Whole gene is transcribed in pre-mRNA
	- Then, splicing occurs, taking about 10% of the protein
	- This is matured mRNA
- Then, there also is t-RNA (transfer RNA)
- Amino acids fuse to the tRNA, making it in a certain form: *clover-leaf form*
	- t-RNA carry a specific amino acid. Different neurons in our brain ecpress diferent tRNAs. Some are expressed at higher levels than others
- There is an enzyme *synthetase* which put an aminoacid on top of the tRNA. with an high-energy bond
	- This requires energy, ATP -> AMP
- Each tRNA binds to its codon in RNA (transient)

### Ribosome
- A complex molecular machine built up of over 100 proteins in a single *complex*
	- that build proteins
- [[Stages protein production by ribosome]]
- How does it work?
	1. There is a growing polypeptide chain in the complex
		- the tRNA binds tot he RNA with three bases at a time
	2. the peptides on the tRNA bind together --> grows again
	3. Large subunit translocates (conformational change)
	4. Small subunit translocates
	1. A new tRNA binds in the subunit to the mRNA
- Multiple binding sites on a single mRNA 
	- they have initiation factors --> having problems here can lead to brain problems
- There are multiple stopcodon (*AUG*)--> does not have a tRNA, but recognized by protein called *release-factor*
- At the highest magnification with electron microscope we can see a single mRNA making multiple proteins
- mRNA is degraded by the cytosol
- type 1 or type 3 mRNA polymerase transcribes non-protein mRNA
