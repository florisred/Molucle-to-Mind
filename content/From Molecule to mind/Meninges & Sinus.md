## What are the meninges?
- Brain & spinal cord are protected by the skull and vertebrae
	- Three sheets of tissue, the *meninges* and the *CSF* provide additional protection
- From outside to in:
	1. *Dura mater*
		-  Has multiple *folds*
		- *Falx Cerebri*: the layer between the two hemnispheres
		- *Falx cerebelli*: small fold between cerebellum and cerebrum
		- *Tentorium cerebelli*: fold between cerebellum and cerebrum
			- Herniation bc of a hematoma can cause the brain to move along the tentorium, eventually compressing the brainstem -> can cause coma & death, so not very nice.
			- Symptom: impaired function of the *oculomotor nerve* near brainstem & midbrain
				- Wide pupal and light-sensitive eye. 
		- *Diaframga sellae*: small fold on top of sella turcica
	2. *arachnoid*
	3. *Pia mater*
## What are sinuses
- Blood drain of the brain to the *jugular vein*
- Most important sinuses, related to the falx from before:
	- Inferior & superior sagital sinuses
		- Superior runs along the skull with the falx cerebri
			- Veins from the surface of the brain open into the lacunae
		- Inferior runs along the bottem of the falx cerebri, near the basal ganglia?
		- Flows from *front to back*
		- *Arachnoid granulations*: upward protriusions of the arachnoid
			- Help reabsorb CSF into the bloodstream
	- Straight sinus
		- Runs along the junction of falx and tantorium
		- Recieves from the great cerebral vein and inferior sagital sinus
	- Transverse sinuses
		- Are the *outflow* for all the sini
		- follows the attachment of the tantorium cerebelli
	- Sigmoid sinus
		- Named bc of the form, looks like an s
		- leaves through the jugular foramen
- Sinuses on the base of the skull
	- Cavernous sinuses - one on each side
		- Space around the carotid artery
		- Contains 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerve
## intracranial bleedings
- Bleedings can occur in four different places in the skull
1. *Epidural* -> between skull  & dura mater
2. *Subdural* -> Between dura & arachnoid
3. *Subarachnoid* -> between arachnoid & pia
4. *Intracerebral* -> inside of the brain, under the pia
## Leptomeninx
- Consist of arachnoid and pia mater
	- Arachnoid attaches to dura, pia to brain -> sometimes there are subarachnoid spaces called *cisterns* filled with CSF
		- Lumbar puncture goes to *lumbar cistern* or *cistern magnum* -> under cerebellum
