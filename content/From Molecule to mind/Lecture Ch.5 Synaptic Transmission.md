[[Ch5. Synaptic transmission]]
## Types of synapses
### Electrical synapse
- Passive
- Stable structures called *Gap junctions*
- Allow currents to flow through
- Astrocytes form networks that are connected by such channels
- Also allows ions to pass through
	- Passes on depolarization --> action potential
- When we zoom into the *stable channels* there are six proteins that form a pore
	- They bind together with the same six proteins in the other cell
	- They are called *connexons*
- Neurons age with us, maybe even 100 years you're working with the same neurons
	- Connexons will be stable along that time
### Chemical synapse
- Active --> many different parts that activate each others
- Neurons are very close to each other --> allows for high complexity
- Axons are very thin --> very hard to see with only GFP
- There is a high number of synapses -> high complexity
	- Computational power that this organization allows is tremendous
## Structure of synapses
- they are completely packed against each other
- synapses are black in the microscope
	- Because they are stained (osmium staining)
		- Osmium sits onto everything that is dense --> electronmicroscope can find this
- Pre synaptic site has the black density
	- Sometimes there are two per synapse
- Post-synaptic density
- *Endocitic vesicles*: they retake membrane (the vesicles fuse with the membrane, would cause swelling)
	- This membrane is then used to make new synaptic vesicles
### Synthesis in synapses
- Small molecule neurotransmitter: synaptic vesicle cycle can operate independent from the soma. This is good, as the soma is far away sometimes.  Synthesis in cell body
- Dense-core vesicles with peptide neurotransmitter
	- These are made in the Golgi, are brought to the synapse through *axonal transport*
## Fusion efficiency
The distribution of these two vesicles is different. Dense core are further away from the active zone
- Calcium influx triggers vesicle release
- Low frequency stimulation:
	- Leads to the preferential release of small molecule vesicles
	- Entry of calcium is highly localized, with many absorption mechanisms
- High frequency stimulation:
	- More diffuse increase in Calcium, releases both types neurotransmitters
## Quantal events in the neuromuscular junction
- MEPPS (miniature end plate potential) 
	- Is a very weak stimulation (1mV) --> corresponds to the fusion of the vesicle
- Is the amplitude of those event a bell curve? --> no!
	- Therefore it is not a regular stochastic curve
	- there are regular patterns! each peak corresponds to a single vesicle!

	- If you were to make the cell more receptive, you would shift the X-axis to the right,  and stretch it out. 
	- If there is a positive change in pre-synaptic reliability, the relative height of the different quanta would go up
	- There are like 10,000 molecules going into the cell
## The entire loop

- After you stimulate a synapse real hard, you will find that the amount of membrane increases and the tension goes down *a few percent, for a little bit*. 
## the bottom steps
- The snare complex sits in the membrane
	- Calcium activates synaptotagmin --> like a safety pin
		- In a viral protein the cellular SNAREpins are together
		- Very ancient principle, conserved throughout billions of years of evolution

	- All these steps happen within 1 milisecond.
