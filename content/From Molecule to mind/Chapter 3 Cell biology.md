# Energy, Catalysis, and Biosynthesis
## Introduction
One property above all makes living things seem almost miraculously different from nonliving matter: they create and maintain order in a universe that is tending always toward greater disorder.
Most of the chemical reactions that cells perform would normally occur only at temperatures that are much higher than those inside a cell.
- So, we need a *[[catalyzer]]*. Done by *[[Enzime|enzimes]]*
- These enzyme-catalyzed reactions are usually connected in series, so that the product of one reaction becomes the starting material for the next 
	- *Metabolic pathway*
	- Using different catalyzers, a cell can precisely control all its processes (metabolism) to stay alive.
- Two opposing streams govern the metabolism:
	- The *catabolic pathway* (catabolism)
		- breaks down foodstuffs into smaller molecules, thereby generating both a useful form of energy for the cell and some of the small molecules that the cell needs as building blocks
	- The *anabolic pathway* (anabolism, biosynthetic)
		- uses the energy harnessed by catabolism to drive the synthesis of the many molecules that form the cell.
## Use of energy by cells
### Biological order is made Possible by the release of heat energy from Cells
- The universal tendency of things to become disordered is expressed in a fundamental law of physics, the *second law of thermodynamics*.
	- in the universe or in any isolated system (a collection of matter that is completely isolated from the rest of the universe), the degree of disorder can only increase.
		- systems will change spontaneously toward those arrangements that have the greatest probability.
	- The measure of a system’s disorder is called the *entropy* of the system, and the greater the disorder, the greater the entropy.
		- Systems spontaneously move to a state of greater entropy.
- Cells are ordered, but release heat into the system (environment) which causes more disorder
	- Second law of thermodynamics is satisfied
### Cells Can Convert energy from one form to another
According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy cannot be created or destroyed—but it can be converted from one form to another.
- Chemical bond energy converted to heat --> more disorder in entire universe, but more usable energy in cell
	- by directly linking the “burning” of food molecules to the generation of biological order—cells are able to create and maintain an island of order in a universe tending toward chaos.

### Photosynthetic organisms Use sunlight to synthesize organic Molecules
- Plants obtain energy directly from sunlight
	- All animals live on energy from the sun
### Cells obtain energy by the oxidation of organic Molecules
- To use this energy to live, grow, and reproduce, organisms must extract it in a usable form. 
	- In both plants and animals, energy is extracted from food molecules by a process of gradual oxidation, or controlled burning.
	- In this atmosphere, C02 and H20 are more stable forms of carbon and hydrogen
		- Therefore, oxidizing releases energy (cellular respiration)
