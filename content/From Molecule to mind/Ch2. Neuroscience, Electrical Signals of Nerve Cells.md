# Overview
- Nerve cells generate a variety of electrical signals.
	- These signals transmit information.
- Neurons are not intrinsically good conductors of electricity.
	- They have elaborate mechanisms to generate electrical signals, or *Action potentials*
- The *resting membrane potential* is a negative potential.
	- It can be measured by recording the voltage between the inside and outside of nerve cells.
	- Action potentials are propagated along the length of axons by positively polarizing the membrane.
- Other types of electrical signals are produced by synaptic contacts or external forms of energy.
	- These signals arise from ion fluxes brought about by ion channels and active transporters.
