## Glutamate
- Most important neurotransmitter
	- Nearly all excitatory neurons in the *CNS* are *glutamatergic*
		- Means that they respond to glutamate
	- More than half of all synapses in brain release it!
- Can cause *excitotoxic brain damage* 
- Is a *nonessential amino acid* (we can produce it ourselves)
- Does *not* cross the *Blood-brain barrier* -> has to be synthesized in neurons from precursors like *glutamine*
	- Is turned into *glutamate* by mitochondrial enzyme *glutaminase*
- Once synthesized, it's put into vesicles by *VGLUT* (vesicular glutamate transporters)
- Once released in the *synaptic cleft*, Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (*EAATS*) transport it into [[Glial Cells]] 
	- It is then converted back into *glutamine* in the glial cell and transported by SN1 back into the nerve terminals
		- Why glutamine? -> otherwise it is active when transporting back!!
	- Called the *glutamate-glutamine cycle* (name not very original)
- Can also be directly reuptaken by the synapse
### Ionotropic Glutamate receptors
- [[Neurotransmitter receptors#ionotropic receptors / Ligand-gated ion channels|Ionotropic receptors]] for glutamate: 
	- *AMPA*, *NMDA*, and *Kainate* receptors
	- All named after the antagonists that activate them
- Once activated, they allow Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> to pass

|      **Receptor Type**             |    **EPSC Properties**                    |             **Function**                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AMPA              | Fast, Large            | Primary mediators of excitatory transmission in the brain                       |
| NMDA              | Slow, Long-lasting     | Identified using selective antagonist drugs                                     |
| Kainate           | Quick rise, Slow decay | Found on presynaptic terminals (feedback mechanism), postsynaptic cells (EPSCs) |
#### AMPA receptors
- Composed of 4 different *subunits* (Glu1-Glu4)
	- [[structure of the AMPA receptor]]
- Not symmetrical, Y-shaped. 
#### NMDA receptors
- Allows in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, important for [[long term potentiation]].
- Also allows in K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>
- Mg<sup>2+</sup> blocks the pore, and depolarization pushes it out of the pore (two positives avoid each other)
	- Therefore, a synapse must be both stimulated by glutamate and very depolarized in order to release    Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the cell -> synapse plasticity (chapter 8)
### Metabotropic glutamate receptors
- called *mGluRs*
	- Cause slower postsynaptic responses that can either *excite* or *inhibit* synapses
- Like all G-protein coupled receptors, they hare dimers of two identical subunits
	- Each with a *venus flytrap domain* connected to the transmembrane domain
	- Binding of *glutamate* causes flytrap domains to close, allowing G-protein to bind to the receptor
