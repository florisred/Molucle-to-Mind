[[Ch6. Neurotransmitters and Their Receptors]]
## Types of neurotransmitters
- Small-molecule
- Peptide Neurotransmitters
	- In the gut, you have about the same amount of neurons as in brain --> mostly uses neuropeptides
		- Looks like Invertebrates --> they also use neuropeptides
	- Therefore, neuropeptides are probably older 
## Acetyl Choline
- Acetyl and Choline are both in axoplasm
	- Bound together, put in a synaptic vesicle of like 10,000
	- Vesicle fuses with membrane, acetylcholine will go in synaptic cleft, bind with [[Neurotransmitter receptors#ionotropic receptors / Ligand-gated ion channels|ionotropic]] receptors
		- ACh is broken down in a few ms by *acetylcholinesterase* into *Choline* and *Acetate* --> reuptake
		- Transported back through Na<sup>+</sup>/choline transporter
## Glutamate
- Predominant *excitatory* neurotransmitter
- *Glutamine* converted to *glutamate* by *glutaminase*
- Transported by *VGLUT* (vesicle glutamate?)
- *Glutamate* pumped away into by *EATT*
	- Most often: *Glial cell* -> [[Glial Cells]], converted to *glutamine* by *glutamine synthetase*
		- In order not to secrete glutamate (active transporter)
	- sometimes also directly goes back to presynaptic terminal
		- Depends on the localization of the astrocytes and the cells
	- This is also why *glutamate* is *cytotoxic*
		- It does *not* get deactivated in the cleft, but stays active till taken up again
		- So, if not taken up, a seizure of activity emerges
- The receptors also need *glycine* and *Mg<sup>2+</sup>* as modulators
## GABA
- Made from glutamate, but is *inhibitory*
- In immature neurons and mature neurons, the concentration of Chloride will be different
	- The *flux* is therefore also different
	- Therefore, GABA in developing brain is *excitatory*

## THC
- It binds all over the place in the brain
	- Hippocampus, caudate putamen, substantia nigra, cerebellum
- It binds where normally *endocannabinoids* bind
	- *Anandamide* and *2-AG*
