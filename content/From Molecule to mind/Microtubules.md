## What are microtubules?
- Long, hollow tubes that spring out from the *centrosome* to the plasma membrane
	- can Rapidly assemble and disassemble
- They are mainly responsible for *cellular transport* of proteins etc
- During *mitosis*, the disassemble and reform into so-called *mitotic spindle*
	- These separate the two chromosomes for the different daughter cells
- Can also form *stable structures* such as the rhythmically beating *cilia* and *flagella*
	- These extend from the outside of the cell, allowing them to *swim* or move
## microtubules are Hollow tubes with structurally distinct ends
- They are made out of *tubulins*
	- A dimer of *[[α-tubulin and β-tubulin]]* that is stacked in a 13-sided hollow tube 
	- all a-tubulin faces the same direction -> gives a *polarity* to microtubules
		- alpha-end: minus end, beta-end: plus end
- They add more rapidly to the plus end than minus end (here the name comes from)

## The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing center in animal cells
- The *centrosome* is typically close to the *nucleus*
- Radiates an array of *microtubules* that go to the plasma membrane
- Consists of *centrioles*, surrounded by a matrix of proteins
- Form a special type of tubulin: *γ-tubulin*
	- γ-tubulin *ring* complex serves as the starting point, or *nucleation* site, for the growth of one microtubule -> minus end embedded in the centrosome, plus end radiating out 
	- These nucleation sites allow the microtubule to be easily started, as they do not spontaneously form in the complex environment of the cell
## Growing microtubules display dynamic instability
- Once started, a tubule will typically grow for a few minutes, then suddenly, start shrinking
	- This pattern is random! Known as *dynamic instability* -> intended
	- It can also be prevented from destabilizing by attaching to another part of the cell
		- The centrosome can be compared to a fisherman casting a line: if there is no bite at the end of the line, the line is quickly withdrawn, and a new cast is made; but, if a fish bites, the line remains in place, tethering the fish to the fisherman.
### dynamic instability is driven by GtP Hydrolysis
- The tubulin dimers can hydrolyze GTP -> 
	- each free dimer contains a GTP molecule bound to the beta-tubulin, which is turned into GDP when the tubule grows
	- When it grows very rapidly, the dimers add faster than GTP can by hydrolized
		- Causes that part of the tubule to have a *GTP-cap*
		- Works protectively
	- Once, by chance, some GTP can be hydrolized at the plus end of the growing tubule, which tips the balance towards shrinking -> tubulin released into the cytoplasm, where it turned back into GTP-tubulin
### Microtubule dynamics impacted by drugs
- *Colchichine* binds to free tubulin, hindering microtubule growth
	- causes cell to stall in mitosis, as mitotic spindles cannot form
- *Taxol* binds to microtubules, making them stable
	- also stalls cell in mitosis
- This helps in battling cancer, as tumors grow more rapidly
## microtubules organize the cell interior
- In specialized cells, tubule dynamics are suppressed, as the microtubules maintain the cell organization, often by *microtubule-associated proteins*
- For example, microtubules protrude from the centrosome to the axon terminal in nerve cells
	- This allows transport of organelles and protein, about 10cm per day
	- [[Microtubules in axons]]
## motor Proteins drive intracellular transport
- Cytoplasm is in continual motion, but small organelles are seen to be moving in *saltatory* steps, jumping, and then stopping.
	- This is done by *motor proteins* along the microtubules or actin filaments, using *ATP hydrolysis*
- [[Two types of motor proteins]] on microtubules:
	- *Kinesins* -> move towards the plus end (outside of cell)
	- *Dyneins* -> move toward the minus end
- They consist of *ATP-binding heads* and a single tail binding to cargo
	- ATP-hydrolosis provides the energy for conformational changes that cause propulsion
### microtubules and motor Proteins Position organelles in the cytoplasm
- They are important for positioning organelles
	- Tubules of the *ER* reach toward the edge of the cell
	- These tubules pull the *ER* outward as the cell grows
	- *Cytoplasmic dyneins* pull the *Golgi* apparatus more inside, towards the nucleus
- When these tubes are disassembled by *colchicine*, the organelles collapse around the nucleus, but are repositioned when colchicine is removed
## cilia and flagella contain stable microtubules moved by dynein
- *Cilia* are hairlike structures covered by the plasma membrane, extending from the cell surface
	- Contains a core of stable microtubules that grow from a *[[basal body]]*
	- The hairs move in a beat, to move water or themselves
		- Locomotion or food collection
	- Cross section of cilium shows a ring of 9 doublet microtubules around two single microtubules
		- Very prominent pattern -> [[9+2 pattern]]
		- *[[Ciliary dynein]]* moves along the middle 'spoke', causing a bending motion that drives motion
- *Flagella* propel sperm, and are like cilia but longer
