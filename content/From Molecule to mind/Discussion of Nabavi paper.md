## What was the goal of the paper?
- to demonstrate a casual link between LTD and LTP and memory
	- Conditioning aninmals with optogenic stimulation and fear
- Green period is wen they have the light ON
	- In the unpaired condition (without the foot shock) there is no change in lever pressing
- First, associate unrelated stimulus *sound* with a reward 
	- Once it is paired with a foot-shock in a certain amount of time, the tone starts to predict a foot shock -> freeze response. No longer a neutral stimulus, but a conditioned one
		- Or they stop lever pressing -> more sensitive and easier to automate
## Optogenetic approach
- What they did, is try to change the auditory stimulus to an optogenetic stimulus
	- Rhodopsin into the thalamus and auditory cortex, using adeno-associative virus
	- Only light does not change lever pressing, but light +  virus *does* create a conditioned response predicting aversive behavior
- you also see a  response in amygdala
