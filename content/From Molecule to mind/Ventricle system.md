### Lateral ventricles
- Each hemisphere has a ventricle: the *lateral ventricles* 
	- Antior horn, posterior horn, inferior horn
- Communicates in the *interventricular foramen* with the other ventricles
### 3rd ventricle
- Has *choroid plexus* which passes through the foramen and passes into the lateral ventricle
- Drains through the *cerebral aqueduct* into the *4th ventricle*
### 4th ventricle
 - Near the medulla / cerebellum, very low.
