## What is the cytoskeleton?
- *Cytoskeleton*: an intricate network of protein filaments that extends throughout the cytoplasm
	- Serves important function in organization, movement (of products), and taking shape
	- Particularly in animal cells, that do not have *cell walls*
- *Cytoskeleton* is highly *dynamic*, continuously reorganized and, in fact, sort of also is a muscle
	- Controls location of organelles, provides the machinery for transport between them
- Consists of three types of filaments:
	- *intermediate filaments, microtubules, and actin filaments*
