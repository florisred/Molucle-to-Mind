## Before the discovery
- Hodgekin and Huxley theorized that ion channels must exist with the following features:
	- Ion channels had to allow ions to pass in great rates
	- currents had to depend on electrochemical gradient
	- have to have some mechanism of regulation with voltage
	- had to pass K+ and Na+ independently
- To study the channels, the *Patch clamp* was invented
## Patch clamp method
- Revolutionized the study of membrane currents
- Can help studying flows of currents of just one ion due to precision
	- So limit a patch of membrane to only allow Na+ to pass
	- depolarizing a squid axon like this causes a tiny current 
		- Called *microscopic currents*
	- All *microscopic currents*  add up to *macroscopic currents* -> bigger region
	- We found that one ion channel has about the same behavior as the system as a whole
		- Can be difficult to see, because ion channels open and close in a *stochastic* manner --> random chance
	- When only Na+ could pass the membrane, and the potential is depolarized, small currents into the cell could be seen --> Na+ influx. 
	- When the membrane potential is depolarized, *microscopic outward currents* observed when Na+ channels are blocked. --> This suggests that K+ is exiting the cell
