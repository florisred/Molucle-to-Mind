# Vesicular transport
- After the ER, proteins are often transported to the *Golgi apparatus* using vesicles 
	-  *vesicular transport*  is done by budding off some membrane from ER and fusing it with golgi
## Transport vesicles carry soluble proteins and membrane between compartments
 - *secretory pathway*: ER -> Golgi -> Cell surface
	 - A side branch of the golgi apparatus also leads to endosomes and lysosomes
 - Inward, *endocytic pathway*: from the plasma membrane, through endosomes, to lysosomes 
	 - [[Secretory vs endocitic pathway golgi]]
- For efficient transport, a vesicle must carry only its desired protein and only fuse with the target membrane. 
	- Therefore, each vesicle must retain its own identity -> all of this is possible due to proteins on the vesicle surface specifying all this
### vesicle budding is driven by the assembly of a protein coat
- Budded vesicles are often *coated vesicles*, because they have a protein coat
	- This coat is shedded once removed from its parent, so that the vesicle membrane can interact
- Often has two functions:
	- Helps *shape* the membrane into a vesicle
	- *Captures* molecules for onward transport
- Again, this is best explained with [[example clathrin vesicle coat]]
	- Dynamin, GTP-binding protein, squeezes the membrane into a bubble
- How does a vesicle select its cargo?
	- Best analyzed with the clathrin vesicle, which uses *adaptins*
	- *adaptins* adhere the clathrin coat to the vesicle, and help select the *cargo*
	- Transport signals on molecules are recognized by *cargo receptors* in the Golgi
		- *Adaptins* trap the cargo receptors that bind them, and the cargo bound to the receptors ends up inside of the vesicle
### vesicle docking depends on tethers and snares
- The specificity with which transport happens, means that every surface is probably identifiable by receptor proteins with special molecular markers
- *Rab proteins* control this identification process
	- They are *monomeric GTPases* that are recognized by *tethering proteins* on the *cystolic side* of the membrane surface -> each organelle & vesicle has a unique set of *Rab Proteins*
- *SNAREs* also help identification 
	- once a tethering proteins have grabbed *Rab*, *v-SNAREs* (vesicle snares) interact with *t-SNAREs* (target snares) to really tether the vesicle to the target
	- After that, they help with releasing the protein by fusing the vesicle membrane
	- the V and T SNAREs pull each other together such that the membrane fuses
- [[vesicle tethering to the cell]]
