## What is gene expression?
- Book: A complex process by which cells selectively direct the synthesis of the many thousands of proteins and RNAs encoded in their genome
	- *cell differentiation* arises because cells make and accumulate different sets of RNA and protein molecules: that is, they *express different genes*.
## Different cell types contain the same DNA
- All cells contain the *same DNA*, but somehow express *different genes* on that DNA.
	- Cells must therefore be able to change 'behavior' without changing the [[The structure of DNA#DNA Consists of Two Complementary Chains of Nucleotides|nucleotide sequence]]
		- Thats why you can clone an animal by replacing the nucleus from an unfertilized egg with an adult differentiated nucleus
## Different cell types produce different kinds of protein
- Many proteins are in common with all cells --> *housekeeping proteins*
	- For basic metabolism or tasks shared with all cells
- However, many proteins are only made by specific differentiations
	- *hemoglobin* is made almost exclusively in developing red blood cells
- A lot of cells can make more or less of a protein in response to cellular signals
	- They can change their *gene expression*
	- This regulation takes place on many different steps [[Ch.7 ECB, From DNA to Protein|from DNA to protein]]
	(1) controlling when and how often a given gene is transcribed,
	(2) controlling how an RNA transcript is spliced or otherwise processed,
	(3) selecting which mRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytosol,
	(4) regulating how quickly certain mRNA molecules are degraded,
	(5) selecting which mRNAs are translated into protein by ribosomes
	(6) regulating how rapidly specific proteins are destroyed after they have been made
