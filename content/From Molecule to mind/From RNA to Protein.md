## Codons
- mRNA sequence is decoded in sets of three nucleotides called a *codon*
	- This means that if only one or two nucleotides are added, the entirety of the gene will be misread. 
- These are read during *translation*, the process of getting proteins from RNA
- There are 64 different possibilities of three different nucleotides
	- Only 20 different amino acids are commonly found
		- Some amino-acids have multiple codons
- *Codons* are recognized by *tRNA* (transfer RNA), that function as *adaptors* between the codons and amino-acids. 
	- tRNA looks like a [[cloverleaf]] when folded & drawn schematically
- The genetic code is *redundant*, there are many different codons that specify a single amino acid. 
- Enzymes called *aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases* couple the amino-acids to the tRNA molecules. 
	- Different *synthetases* for every amino acid --> 20 different
## Ribosomes
- *Ribosomes* are the protein machines that *translate* mRNA into protein and move along mRNA, and *covalantly* link the amino acids
	- Made from *small proteins* and *rRNAs* (ribosomal RNAs)
- Two subunitsL: *large* & *small*
- Start at the 5' end of the chain, which is then pulled through the ribosomes towards the 3'end
	- At the end, the two subunits separate
- [[Figure ribosomes]] and [[Figure translation]]
- *Ribosome* is one of the largest and most complex structures in the cell
- A *ribosome* is a *ribozyme*. A Ribozyme is any RNA molecule that possess catalytic power.
## Start and stop codons
- First, a ribosome binds to the 5'-cap of an mRNA and starts looking
- Translation starts with the start codon *AUG*!
	- This is recognized by a special charged *initiator tRNA*
	- Always carries methionine
		- Newly made proteins always have Methionine at their    *N-terminus* (usually removed later) 
	- then the ribosome starts doing its thing until it finds the *stop codon*
- Works different in bacteria, as their mRNA often contain multiple proteins so ribosomes bind at other places than just the 5'-cap
	- The *stop codon* (*UAA, UAG, and UGA*) aren't recognized by tRNA but instead signal to the ribosome to stop translation
		- *release factors* make sure this happen
- This synthesis takes about 20sec to some minutes
	- When a ribosome has translated a little, a new ribosome immediately binds again --> multiple proteins made at the same time -> *polysomes*
### Inhibitors of prokaryotic protein synthesis as antibiotics
- We take advantage of the small differences between prokaryote and eukaryote ribosomes to block RNA translation and kill cells
## Protein breakdown
- *Proteases*: Enzymes that break down proteins by cutting peptide bonds
	- *Proteasomes* do this in eukaryotic cells
		- Present in both nucleus and cytosol
		- Breaks down damaged and mis-folded proteins
		- Done by ATP hydrolysis
		- Contain cilinders in which the protein is broken down
- How are proteins selected to die?
	- *Ubiquitin* tagging done by enzymes
	- Done when certain conformational motifs that normally remain obscure are visible
