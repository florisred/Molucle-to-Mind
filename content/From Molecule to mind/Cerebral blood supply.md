# Blood supply of the brain
- Brain consumes *a lot* of blood (2% of body weight, but 20 of oxygenated blood goes there)
- Goes to brain by two routes
## Vertebrobasilar system
- Two vertebral arteries come together to form the *basilar artery* 
- form 20% of the blood supply
## Internal carotid system
- supplies 80%, and enterns the circle of willis near the optic chiasm
- gives off the *posterior* artery, and then becomes the *middle cerebral* artery
## Circle of willis 
- From front to back, lie between floor of the brain and floor of the skull
	- *Anterior communicating artery* (bridge between the two anterior cerebral arteries)
	- *Anterior cerebral artery*
	- *internal carotid arteries*
	- *Posterior communicating artery* (between anterior and posterior arteries)
	- *Posterior cerebral arteries*
### Anterior cerebral artery
- Turn upwards and then backwards (just above the corpus callosum)
- to cerebral fissure
- Supplies medial anterior and medial medial parts of the brain
	- Goes up to between the hemispheres and supplies the caudal parts of the lateral anterior and medial parts of the brain
- Clinical relevance: if a stroke happens, you will get *sensory and motor problems with the leg*
### Middle cerebral artery
- Enters *lateral cerebral fissure*, between frontal and temporal lobe
- Gives off branches along the length of the lateral cerebral fissure, supplying the lateral medial and lateral posterior parts of the brain
- Clinical relevance: if a stroke happens, you will get
	- *Total motor and sensory problems* -> also lower body / leg, as those fibres run through the *internal capsule*, which supplied by the middle cerebral artery
	- *language problems*: Both *broca* and *wernicke* affected (language production / comprehension respectively) -> *aphasia*
### Posterior cerebral artery
- runs around cerebral peduncle to most of the medial posterior of the brain, and a small boomerang-like formation of the lateral posterior part of the brain 
- Clinical relevance: if a stroke happens, you will get *visual problems*, as the *occipital lobe* is supplied by this artery
## This is all very difficult to comprehend. I know. A nice map with blood supply and functional map combined to help y'all out a little:
