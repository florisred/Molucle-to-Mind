# Somatosensory system
- Perceive external information and integrate it
	1. Posterior column-medial lemniscus system
	2. Anterolateral system
	3. Trigeminal system

## Poster column-medial lemniscus system
### Functions
- Fine touch, textures
- Vibration
- Proprioception --> the ability where our body is
### Decussation & pathway
- Comes in through Dorsal columns  -> goes to medulla brainstem ->  decussation -> medial lemniscus -> thalamus
## Anterolateral system
- Name origin: Anterolateral quadrant of the spinal cord
- Consists of three parts
	1. **Spinothalamic tract** -> most important and longest
	2. Spinoreticular tract
	3. spinomesencephalic tract
- Functions
	- Nociception -> feeling pain (only in the body)
	- temperature
	- crude touch
### Nociception: First vs Second pain
1. First pain: A-delta fibers
	- Spinothalamic tract 
	- What you feel very quickly 
1. Second pain: C-Fibres
	- Spinoreticular tract
	- spinomesenphalic tract
	- Takes longer
## Trigeminal system 
- 3 brances
	1. Opthalmic
		- top part
	2. Maxillary
		- Teeth / jaw
	3. Mandibular
		- lower part of face
- 4 nuclei
	- Mesenpahlic; proprioception
	- pricipal sensory; fine touch and pressure
	- spinal trigeminal; thermo and nocicpetive fibres
	- Motor
- First order noeuron in the grigeminal ganglion 7, 8, and 9
### Proprioception
- also via trigeminal nerve
- cell bodies in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus
- muscle spindles and golgi tendron organs
# Autonomic Nervous system
- Part of Peripheral nervous system
- Unconscious movements and organ function
- Sympathetic, parasympathetic, and *enteric -> neural plexus in gut*
- Peripheral synapse in ganglia
