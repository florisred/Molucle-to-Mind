# What is a glial cell?
## Basics
- Just as common as neurons
- Do not carry signals, but fulfill *supportive roles*
- Only *stem cells* in the mature brain
	- Can give rise to new glia and new *[[neurons]]*
- Help maintaining the *ionic mileu* of nerve cells and modulate or regulate synaptic action and many more function discussed later
## Types of Glial Cell
### [[Overview of glial cells]]
### Astrocytes
- Only in the *Central Nervous System* (CNS, brain and spinal cord)
- Look like stars (astro)
- Their job is to maintain the chemical environment for neural signaling
	- Form the *Blood-Brain Barrier*
	- Help making new *synaptic connections*
	- Act like *stem cells*
### Oligodendrocytes
- Only in *CNS*
- Create *Myelin* on *Schwann cells*
- Some oligodendrocytes and schwann cells can also act as stem cells
### Microglial cells
-  Derived from *hematopoietic precursor cells*
- Share many properties with *macrophage cells*
- Scavenger cells that remove celular debris
- Secrete signaling molecules, *cytokines*, just like the immune system
### Glial Stem Cells
- Retain capacity to proliferate and generate additional *precursors* or *differentiated glia*, and sometimes *[[Neurons]]*
- Two types:
	1. Subset of *astrocytes* found near ventricles, in the *Subventricular Zone* and adjacent to *ventricular zone blood vessels*
	2. Oligodendrocyte precursors
