# Ventral view
## Medulla
- Contains nuclei that control basic functions
- Origin of nearly all the cranial nerves
- Continuous with the spinal cord at the *foramen magnum*
- Doral faces directly backwards
- Back of the upper part of medulla forms the floor of the 4th ventricle
- Contains the following structures:
	- *Pyramid*
	- *Pyramidal decussation*
	- *olive*
- Also contains the 12th, 11th, 10th, and 9th [[cranial nerves]]
## Cerebellum
- vermis and hemispheres
- *Choroid plexus* of the 4th ventricle, lateral recess
## Pons (metencephalon)
- Caudal to pons: *abducens nerve (6th)*
- More lateral: *facial nerve (7th)*
- Middle cerebellar peduncle
## Midbrain (mesencephalon)
- Exit *trochlear nerve, 4th*
- Cerebellar peduncles
- Interpeduncular fossa, posterior perforated area
- Exit *oculomotor nerve, 3rd nerve*
## Hypothalamus (diencephalon)
- mammilary bodies
- optic chiasm, optic tract
- hypophyseal stalk
## Telencephalon (cerebrum)
- frontal and temporal lobes
- uncus and piriform lobe
- olfactory bulb, olfactory tract through the olfactory peduncle
- anterior perforated area
