## Receptors
- [[overview receptor types]]
- *Binding* of ligand molecule to the *receptor* triggers a *conformational change* in the receptor
	- This has an effect 
### Channel linked receptors
- Both the *recepting* and the *transducing* part of the signal in one!
- Chemical signal binds (recepting) which causes a conformational change in the protein, which allows ions to pass it (it is a channel, this is the transducing part, from chemical to electrical e.g.)
-  [[Neurotransmitter receptors#ionotropic receptors / Ligand-gated ion channels|Ionotropic receptors]] in the brain
### Enzyme linked receptors
- *Extracellular binding site* -> creates conformational change in *intracellular protein domain*
- Are often *protein kinases* (mostly *tyrosine kinases*) that *phosphorylate* proteins inside the cell
### G-protein / metabotropic coupled receptors 
- [[Neurotransmitter receptors#metabotropic receptors / G-protein coupled receptors|g-protein]]
	- *intermediate* transducing molecule, called a *GTP-binding protein*
- [[Glutamate#Metabotropic glutamate receptors|Glutamate receptors also work with g-protein]]
- *Rhodopsin* transduces light signals (photons) to electrical signals using these G-proteins
#### G-Protein
- Often affect enzymes creating second messengers
	- Takes longer but has a more controlled effect
- Can also directly bind and affect ion channels
- There are *two classes of G-proteins:*
##### Heterotrimeric G-proteins 
- *Heterotrimeric G-proteins* consist of three distinct subunits (α, β, and γ)
	- many different subunits, but they all fall under the same category
	- The *α-subunit* binds either *GTP* or *GDP*
		- When bound with a *GDP* molecule, it becomes an *inactive trimer*
			- Allows it to bind to β, and γ subunits
	- Once this has happened, it is possible for a receptor protein to *replace* the GDP for *GTP*
		- The alpha subunit breaks loose again and the beta-gamma subunit can affect effector proteins
			- This costs one p, so the GTP becomes GDP again -> cycle
			- beta-gamma subdomain affects many receptors -> *amplification*
##### Monomeric (small) G-proteins
- *Monomeric GTPases*
- act as _molecular timers_, active when bound to _GTP_ and inactive after hydrolyzing GTP to _GDP_
	- Activation occurs when _GDP_ is replaced by _GTP_, controlled by _guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)_
		- _GEFs_ activate specific or multiple G-proteins and are themselves activated by binding to activated receptors, often via _adaptor proteins_
	- _Termination of signaling_ occurs via _GTP hydrolysis_, regulated by _GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)_
		- _GAPs_ replace GTP with GDP, returning G-proteins to their inactive state
		- Initially discovered as regulators of small G-proteins, GAPs also regulate the α subunits of _heterotrimeric G-proteins_
### Intracellular receptors
- Are in the cells (as the name suggests of course)
	- Meaning that they bind *lipophilic molecules* -> they have to be able to pass the fatty membrane after all
- Located in *cytoplasm* or *nucleus*
- Often lead to mRNA and protein production
