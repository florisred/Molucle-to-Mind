## What are the cranial nerves
- They are numbered by the order in which they leave the cranial cavity
- From rostral to caudal (back to front of brain), first to twelfth: 
1. Olfactory cranial nerve
	- Very short, just above cribriform plate
2. Optic nerve
	- Come from the optic chiasm, towards optic canal, above the carotid artery
	- Not really a nerve, but a piece of brain -> covered by all meningeal layers
	- The right parts of both eyes go to the left, the left parts go to the right at the optic chiasm
3. Oculomotor
	- Between cerebral peduncle
	- Goes through *superior orbital fissure*
4. Trochlear
	- Goes through *superior orbital fissure*
5. [[Trigeminal nerve]]
	- Largest of the cranial nerve, and most complex
	- Sensation to face, nasal cavity, and oral cavity
	- To provide motor supply to muscles of matication
	- from pons to trigeminal cave, where it splits
	- Has three major branches
		- opthalmic -> superior orbital fissure
			- goes to forehead, lacrimanal nerve (crying), and provides sensation to eyeball
		- maxillary -> foramen rotundum 
			- Upper lip, middle face, to lower part of nose
		- Mandibular -> foramen ovale
			- Lower part of head, jaw
6. Abducens -> from below the pons (pyramis)
	-  Goes through *superior orbital fissure*
7. interomedial facial nerve ->
8. vestibulocochlear nerve -> hearing and balance
9. glossopharyngeal nerve -> sensory, motor, and parasympathetic to throat  
10. vagus nerve -> *the big one*
11. accessory nerve -> motor to neck
12. hypoglossal nerve -> tongue muscles
