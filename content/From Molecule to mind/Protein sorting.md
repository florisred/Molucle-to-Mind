## proteins are transported into organelles by three mechanisms
- All protein synthesis begins in the *cytosol* on *ribosomes*
	- After that, they have to be transported to their appropriate place
- Organelles to which proteins are delivered directly from the *cytosol*:
	- *mitochondria, chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and the interior of the nucleus*
- Organelles to which proteins are delivered indirectly via the *ER*
	- *Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, and the inner nuclear membrane*
- How does that work?
## proteins are transported into organelles by three mechanisms
- The fate of any protein molecule synthesized in the cytosol depends on its amino acid sequence
	- Can contain a *sorting signal* -> if not, they remain in the cytosol
		- 15-60 amino-acids long, often removed after sorting
			- These are sufficient and necessary to direct the protein
	- But if they do, they are transported into the organelle
- But how? if the membrane is normally impermeable?
- Three different ways in three organelles:
	- Cytosol -> nucleus:
		- Proteins actively transported through the *nuclear pores*
		- *Nuclear pores* allow smaller molecules to pass passively
	- Cytosol -> ER, mitochondria, or chloroplasts:
		- Transported by *protein translocators* on the membrane
		- They unfold to carry a protein across the membrane
	- ER -> other parts of ER
		- *Transport vesicles*: pinch off from the membrane of one compartment and then fuse with the membrane of a second
## proteins enter the nucleus through nuclear pores 
- *[[Nuclear envelope]]*: two layers of membrane around the DNA
	- *Inner membrane*: contains some proteins that act as binding sites for the chromosomes
	- *Outer membrane*: continuous with ER
	- It also has *[[nuclear pores]]*: large holes in the membrane that allow proteins 
		- the proteins contain disordered complexes that form a mesh blocking entry
		-  If a signal, *nuclear localization signal*, is detected by *nuclear import receptors*, proteins or RNA can enter or leave through these pores
		- This is done by GTP->GDP hydrolysis
		- This way, proteins are delivered wholly, this is different from entering mitochondria
## proteins unfold to enter mitochondria and chloroplasts
- Both make some of their own proteins with their own DNA -> mitochondrial DNA
	- Most are still made in the cytosol with Nucleus DNA
- Proteins are transported to the organelle, and have to unfold in order to enter
	- *[[Chaperone proteins]]* pull the protein further inside and refold them once inside
	- After the first signal sequence has been removed, further signal sequences open up that direct to a specific place within the organelle
- Not only proteins, but *lipids* (for membrane) also have to be imported
	 - Done by *lipid-carrying protein*
## proteins enter peroxisomes from both the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum
- *Peroxisomes* contain enzymes creating *hydrogen peroxide* (hence their name)
	- They break down toxic chemicals & other molecules
	- Delivered with a three amino acid long sequence, recognized by receptor proteins in the cytosol
- They sometimes also utilize proteins from the ER, these are delivered via *transporter vesicles*
## proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum While being synthesized
- There are two types of protein delivered to the ER from the cytosol
	- *Water-soluble proteins* are completely translocated across the ER membrane and are released into the ER lumen
	- *Prospective transmembrane proteins* are only partly translocated across the ER membrane and become embedded in it -> they are stuck in membrane, already the case here
- Proteins do *NOT* re-enter the cytosol after being delivered to the ER.
	- Will be transported in *transport vesicles*
- Proteins enter the ER before the entire chain has been synthesized
	- The *ribosomes* synthesizing the protein must therefore be attached to the ER membrane
	- these membrane-bound ribosomes create the *rough endoplasmic reticulum*
- Aside from the membrane-bound ribosomes, there are also *free ribosomes* in the ER
- The elongation of the protein causes it to move along the ER -> no ATP required
## soluble proteins made on the er are released into the ER lumen
- [[Water-soluble protein in the ER]]
- Two protein components help guide ER signal sequences to the ER membrane: 
	1.  a signal-recognition particle (*SRP*), normally present in the cytosol
	2. an SRP receptor, embedded in the ER membrane, recognizes the SRP
- Once a SRP binds to a ribosome, it stops synthesis. It recommences when an SRP receptor in the ER membrane interacts with it
	- Together, SRP and SRP receptors are a match maker
- Signal sequences are always at the N-terminus in water-soluble proteins
	- They open the channel in the protein translocator
	- After the C-terminus of the protein (the end) has passed the translocation channel, it is released into the ER lumen
## start and stop signals determine the arrangement of a transmembrane protein in the lipid bilayer
- [[Transmembrane protein in the ER]]
- Transmembrane proteins get stuck in the ER membrane -> not released in ER lumen
- In this case, along the protein there is a *stop-transfer sequence*, which halts the transfer proces
	- The signal sequence is removed, but the stop-transfer sequence stays, and the protein is released while in a lipid bilayer -> the N-terminus on the lumenal side of the lipid bilayer and the C-terminus on the cytosolic side
