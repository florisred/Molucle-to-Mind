# Why Myelination?
- *conduction velocity*, the speed with which an AP travels through, is quite low in axons normally
	- Very important for processing speed & information travel
- So how to speed this up?
	1. **increase the axon diameter**, which *decreases* internal resistance to passive current flow --> 2,5-20 times faster
	2.  **Insulate the axonal membrane** 
		- Reduces the ability of the current to leak out of the axon, increasing the distance along the axon that a given local current can flow passively
		- This is myelination
# How does it work?
- [[Glial Cells#Oligodendrocytes|Oligodendrocytes]] in the CNS and *Schwann cells* in the PNS, wrap the axon in a fatty substance of **myelin**. 
	- This is made of *closely opposed glial membranes*
		- can speed up conduction from 0.5-2m/s to 120m/s
- Because most of the axon is insulated, the only place where [[Action potentials]] can be created is in the gaps, called the *Nodes of Ranvier*
	- Makes the propagation **Saltatory**
