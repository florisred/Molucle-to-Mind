## LTP 
- In the mammalian brain, some *patterns of brain activation* lead to a lasting increase in activity
	- We call this *long-term potentiation*, or *LTP*
- Some other patterns lead to a lasting *decrease of activity* -> *Long-term depression*, *LTD*
- LTP has most rigorously been studied in the *hippocampus*, as thats where memories be
	- We can test living slices of the hippocampus! --> like [[this example of hippocampus]]
### Hippocampus & LTP
- The slices we can see in the example have some important structures
- Cell bodies of the pyramidal neurons lie in a single densely packed layer that is easily visible
	- This consists of the *CA1* and *CA3*
		- The dendrites of the *CA1* receive synapses from *Schaffer collaterals*, the axons of pyramidal cells in the *CA3 region*
	- Electric stimulation of the *Schaffer collaterals* cause [[EPSP, IPSP, and potential summation#Excitatory and Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials|EPSPs]] of CA1 cells
		- If they fire very quickly, there is a long-lasting increase in *amplitude* 
			- Sometimes for more than a year, so pretty damn long
### What is required for LTP to happen?
- First, LTP requires *strong* *activity* in both *presynaptic and postsynaptic* neurons
	- If an *action potential* in the *presynaptic Schaffer collateral* occurs (normally only gives EPSPs) is paired with strong *depolarization* of the *postsynaptic CA1*, LTP occurs
		- It requires the two to be *linked in time* very closely -> 100ms
	- This suggests the presence of a so-called *coincidence detector*
- Secondly, it must be *synapse-specific*
	- This is because, if a specific synapse undergoes LTP, the other synapses of that cell do not get LTP-ed. -> this is logical, as this makes it possible to integrate information well
		- Every synapse holds information, there are tens of thousands of synapses per neuron, and even more cells in the hippocampus -> this allows us to store so much information!
- Thirdly, it must have *associativity*
	- As noted, if a single synapse does not show enough activation, it will not undergo *LTP*
		- However, if a neighboring pathway is stimulated strongly at the same time as one is activated weakly, *both will undergo LTP* -> associativity
		- Think a little bit on how this is a cellular analogue for *pavlovian conditioning*
