## What is Gene expression?
- If we have an organisms genome, we cannot reconstruct what it will look like or do. 
- Not all genes are always being translated into proteins -> this selectivity is called *gene expression*
	- In small & simple bacteria this is the case, but in multicellular organisms even more 
		- Think of how cells *specialize*, all from one beginning cell
