## Changes in Nucleosome Structure Allow Access to DNA
- What are *nucleosomes*? --> [[The structure of eukaryotic chromosomes#Nucleosome|Nucleosomes]]
- There are several ways cell change their *chromatin* structure
	- *chromatin* is the complex of DNA and protein attached to it
	- One such way is through *chromatin-remodeling complexes*
		- These are [[How proteins work#Protein Machines|protein machines]] that use ATP hydrolysis energy to change DNA position
			- Attach to *[[The structure of eukaryotic chromosomes#Nucleosomes Are the Basic Units of eukaryotic Chromosome Structure|histone octamer]]* and DNA and make DNA more acessible
			- These are de-activated during mitosis such that they stay compact
	- Can also be done by binding covalently to the octamer
		- This can also have more different regulatory effects
## Interphase Chromosomes Contain Both Condensed and more extended Forms of Chromatin
- The alteration of chromatin packing thus has a large effect on interphase chromosomes
	- They are condensed and unpacked at different places --> normally about 20-30% of genes is expressed in a given cell
- The highest condensed form is *Heterochromatin* --> abt 10% of the chromosome,mostly around centromeres and telomeres
	- Stops when it finds a specific barrier (i think like the blue in the picture below)
- The rest is called *Euchromatin*![[Pasted image 20240925144055.png]]
- If there is a DNA deletion of some sort, heterochromatin can keep spreading, sometimes making essential genes very poorly expressed, causing **disease**
- When a cell divides, the daughter cells usually have the same chromatin structure 
	- This is essential for *cell memory* ![[Pasted image 20240925144525.png]]
