## equilibrium potential

the amount of concentration change for 1 action potential is very low
- whole cell is much bigger --> equilibrium potential doesn't really change
- only a handful of ions necessary

## GABA differences before and after birth
- besides Na+ en K+, there are also Cl- and GABA pumps
	- Before birth, Cl- is an excitatory ion
		- Lot of chloride inside
		- When GABA is opened, Cl- will go out
			- Inside becomes more positive
	- During birth, bit of an hazardous event
		- Pumps require ATP, made with oxidated phosphorilation
		- during birth --> ATP stops, less pumping
		- Around birth, Cl- pump is blocked
			- Before birth, equilibrium potential for chloride is above membrane potential
			- If GABA receptors open, depolarisation, excitatory
			- If then Chloride pumps are blocked, the equilibrium potential is brought to or below membrane potential
				- If then GABA receptors open, polarisation, inhibitive
					- Postnatally it continues falling, making GABA inhibitive
					- due to Oxytocin
## What does it mean that the membrane is charged
- IONs like to be in water, and hydrophilic
	- Lipids are hydrophobic, so ions cannot go through
	- therefore, if there are positively charged ions are outside the cell and cannot enter, there will be a charge
		- The membrane acts as an insulating layer between two different charges

What is the 

  

Q:

- What is the action potential threshold?

A: 

The membrane potential at which the positive feedback cycle of

 depolarization that leads to the opening of more sodium channels that leads to more depolarization is unleashed.

  

Q: What determines the maximum voltage that is reached at the peak of the cation potential?

A: The equilibrium potential of sodium.

  

Q: What causes the hyperpolarization?

A: The equilibrium potential  of potassium. 

Q: What limits the speed of action potential propagation?  
A: The axonal axial resistance, open channels in the action membrane, charging of the axon membrane, activating sodium channels.

  

Q: What solutions have emerged during evolution to speed up action potential propagation?

A: Myelinization of axons, large axon diameter.

**Mental ability**

**What are the neurobiological factors driving human mental ability**

1. Brain size, neuron numbers

- Rat has about 200 million neurons
- Human brain has 1352 gram, 86 billion neurons

- Therefore, there is a correlation between neurons / brain size and intelligence, but not everything

- Humans have more neocortex

  

  

**Classical cortical structure in mammalian brain**

- Typical sensory and motor neocortex has 6 layers
- Pyramidal cells are the main excitatory neuron type found in deep and superficial cortical layers

- Their dendrites and axons make specific projections over across or within the cortical layer

- Stellate cells mostly keep a horizontal position within the same layer
- Evolutionary older brain regions paleocortex and archicortex have 3 and 4 layers respectively

- Hippocampus  (archicortex)

  

Evolutionary expansion of human cortical layers 2 and 3

- Compared to other mammals, the layer 2 and 3 are comparatively large in humans

- But, is this important for human cognition? Dubitable. 
- So:

**Do neuronal properties differ among species?**

- In classical epilepsy, part of the hippocampus deteriorates and needs to be removed

- Therefore, some of the cortex is removed to access that part (same with tumors)
- This tissue can be used for studies!
- Then we can look multi modally:
- Neuron physiology
- Dendritic structure
- Cortical structure
- [[From DNA to RNA#RNA|RNA]] patch-seq
- MRI Brain imaging
- Cognitive tests

  

**What do we find here?**

- Cortical thickness correlates with IQ
- Do all layers contribute to this?

- Temporal cortical L2 and L3 thickness association with verbal IQ

- Dendrite length associates with cortical thickness and IQ scores
- Neuron size and dendritic complexity also correlate with higher IQ scores

  

  

**Do functional properties of neuron differ?**

**Synaptic communication between pyramidal neurons (L2/L3)**

Human L2/L3 cells vs Mice L2/L3 cells

- AP strength and reliability:
- Human excitatory synapses are stronger and more reliable than those of mice.

- Why could this be?

- Human excitatory synapses carry more cargo

- There are more vesicles in human synapses
- The vesicles are also larger

- This makes the amplitude of the signal higher, and also makes it more likely

- Short-term plasticity

- If you make action potentials repeatedly, the response becomes temporarily less strong
- Human synapses recover faster from this.

- Probably because there are more vesicles. 

- Around of information:

- Per synapse, the human synapses transfer more information
