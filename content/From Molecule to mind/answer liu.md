## Liu paper assignments:  
1 – overall research question, from abstract and introduction,  
2 – overall approach, what are immediate early genes, why dentate gyrus, why c-fos ?  
3 – optogenetic tagging Figure 1A, B, explain transgenic strategy (tTA, TRE), viruses used,  
injection locations, role of doxycycline, use methods section  
4 – explain Figure 1C, experimental protocol, what do the authors expect to achieve?  
- Why is the light on during habituation?\
	- The same animal undergoes the exact same treatment before and after
5 – explain Figure 1d-g, expression of eYFP,  
6 – explain supplementary figure 1  
7 – explain Figure 2a-h, expression in different experimental and control groups  
8 – explain supplementary figure 2  
9 – explain figures 2i-k  
- When you have channelrhodopsin in 
- Control experiment to show that activity is light-related
10 – explain figures 2L-n  
- shows the probability that a neuron will fire if exposed to light
- at 0 they turn on the blue light, and they mark when there was an action potential
11 – explain supplementary Figure 3  
- You see that in neurons with chnrhdp they overlap more
12 – explain supplementary Figure 4  
- If you activate DG, the CA3 will also express c-fos.
13 – explain Figure 3A,  
- The only thing that causes freezing is the light after freeze response training
- But, light by itself does not
14 – supplementary Figure 5  
- They did this task on five consecutive days -> they show that it is similar across the days so they can take the average
15 – explain Figures 3B, C  
- Other mice treated without shock or different gene do not show light-induced fear condition
16 – explain supplementary Figure 6  
- Both NS and DC group show about the same activation of channelrhodopsin
- Context is same, but brain-wide engram would ofc be very different
17 – explain supplementary Figure 7  
- After they are off dox, we start seeing EYFP expression
- not in the non-chnrdhpsn ones
18 – explain Figure 3D-F  
- D: exp-1day -> bc since the animals were taken off dox for three days, there might have been unrelated memories also in the dendrate gyrus (bc it would have been tagged during the two days) so they use only 1 day, wihth a higher response
- E: use bilateral injection -> better
19 – explain supplementary figure 8  
- Check if it makes sense that 3D would be better with one day off dox
	- it is sufficient for still creating 'engrams', and ones with fear response have significantly more activated neurons -> probably a stronger memory?
	- Home cage is familiar environment -> no new memories
20 – explain supplementary figure 9  
21 – explain Figures 4A  
22 – explain Figures 4B-G  
23 – explain Figures 4H, I,  
24 – supplementary figures 10.  
25 – supplementary figures 11.  
26 – What are the main conclusions of the paper?  
27 – where does it go beyond existing literature, what discussion points are mentioned?
