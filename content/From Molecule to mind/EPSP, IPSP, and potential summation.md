## Excitatory and Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials
- These PSPs determine if an action potential starts in the post-synaptic membrane
	- *Excitatory post-synaptic potential*(EPSP) increase the chance of [[Action potentials]]
	- *Inhibitory post-synaptic potential*(IPSP) decrease the chance of them.
- Whether a synapse is EPSP or IPSP depends on the channel coupled to the receptor
	- The only distinction between postsynaptic excitation and inhibition is the reversal potential of the PSP in relation to the threshold voltage for generating action potentials in the postsynaptic cell
- If a resting potential is -60mV, an EPSP would move it towards 0mV
- Example IPSP:
	- Synapse uses *GABA* as transmitter -> open Cl<sup>-</sup> channel
	- E<sub>cl</sub>=-70mV, E<sub>rest</sub>=-60mV. -> if Cl<sup>-</sup> flows in the cell, the synapse will become hyper-polarized
	- IPSP does not have to be *hyperpolarizing*
		- If E<sub>Cl</sub>=-50mV and the potential threshold was -40mV, it would still be inhibitory as it moves it away from the potential threshold. 
## Summation of synaptic potentials
- Individual *EPSPs* or *IPSPs* are only a fraction of a millivolt
	- Individual neurons are innerved by thousands of other neurons --> all these EPSPs and IPSPs add up (*summation*)
