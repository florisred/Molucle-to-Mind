## Signaling transmission at electrical synapses
- In the *gap junction*, the *connexons* are made up of *connexins*.
	- Transmembrane domains, 
	- 21 different genes in humans
- The *connexons* line up perfectly in pre- and postsynaptic membrane
	- Have a pore of 1nm, bigger than [[Ion channels]]
	- Allows cytoplasm and substances to mix between the neurons, sharing ATP
- Electrical neurons are a lot faster than those that use chemicals
- Transmission can be *bidirectional*
## Signaling Transmission at Chemical Synapses
- In the *presynaptic terminal*, the *active* site shows up as a dark blue
	- This is the place where the *synaptic vesicles* release their contents
- In the *postsynaptic* area, the *postsynaptic density* shows up as blue
- When an [[Action potentials|action potential]] arrives, it opens the voltage-regulated *calcium channels* 
	- Rapid influx of *Ca<sup>2+</sup>*  in the presynaptic membrane
	- This allows vesicles to fuse with the cell membrane, releasing their content in *synaptic cleft*
		- This is called *exocytosis*
	- These are then picked up by the membrane receptors of the post-synaptic neuron
		- This then continues the AP.
