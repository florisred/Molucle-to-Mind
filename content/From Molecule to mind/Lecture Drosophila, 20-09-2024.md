# Drosophila
## What is it?
- A fly
- Fly genetics:
	- Transposable elements  
	- Tissue specific expression/development  
	- Forward behavioral screens  
	- Therapy design using forward behavioural screens
## [[Lecture C. Elegans (Roundworm), 18-09-2024#2. Transposons|Transposons]] as a tool
- Transposase protein binds to transposon DNA
	- Excises transposon from host genome (precise/imprecise)
	- Induces integration into novel site of genome DNA
	- (recognizes target sequence)
- using [[Lecture Yeast Model organism, 16-09-2024#Random mutagenesis|random mutagenesis]]

### Genetic manipulation & Classical conditioning in flies
- You can condition flies with a shock, and they will learn how to avoid the shock
	- An odor is connected to a fear response --> Flies learn this!
	- You can then see which flies can fly normally and are 'fit'
		- First Assay
	- Then you can see which flies do not learn fear response --> You see which genes are responsible
		- *There is no single gene responsible for cognition!!*
### Flies & neuronal death pathway
- Death pathway is an **Active Process**
	- If there is axon damage, there is an active pathway to destroy the cells
		- Separate from apoptosis -> Cell body is spared!
		- *lag phase* and *execution phase*

- Johnsons organ Is a sensation neuron in the antennae of the fly
	- detects weight change --> dust --> induces *grooming behavior* in the fly
	- Through [[Optogenics]] we can activate the *CsChrimson* in Johnson's organ
		- Activated by red light, and then induces grooming
	- Then, we cut the axon in the antennae with a very precise and small laser
		- Now, lets study many mutants that still grooms after 3 days (when normally the execution phase would have happened)
		- We can conclude that the axons must still be in the lag phase, not execution phase
			- So, absence of the gene affected *prevents* the execution phase from setting in
			- This would be handy in neurosurgery, so that axons don't kill themselves after
- If you were to feed the Drosophila all approved drugs, and see if any flies still display *grooming* *behavior* after 15 days in the *lag phase*, we know that that drug might be effective
