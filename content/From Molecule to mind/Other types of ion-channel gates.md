# Ligand-Gated Ion Channels
- Many ion channels do not respond to *voltage*, but to *chemical signals*
	- These are called **ligand-gated ion channels**
		- In the nervous system these ligands are often *neurotransmitters*
	- They are essential for synaptic transmission
- They are usually *less selective* than [[Voltage-Gated Ion Channels]]
	- allow multiple types of ions to pass
- Some are sensitive to acid
	- For pain and taste sensations
- Some are sensitive to intracellular second messengers such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>,[[Lecture ECB chapter 16#Second messenger| cAMP and cGMP]]
	- This converts chemical signals into electrical signals
		- *sensory transduction*
# Thermosensitive and Mechanosensitive channels
## Thermosensitive
- Detects heat
- often member of the TRP (*transient receptor potential*) gene family
- open / close in specific temperature ranges
## Mechanosensitive
- Detect distortions in plasma membrane
	- Important in muscle reflexes
