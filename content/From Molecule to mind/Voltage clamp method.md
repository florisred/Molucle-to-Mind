- The voltage clamp technique was invented by Kenneth Cole in the 1940s.
- It controls membrane potential (or voltage) at any level desired by the experimenter.
- The method measures the membrane potential with an electrode placed inside the cell.
- The clamp circuitry passes a current back into the cell through another intracellular electrode.
- This electronic feedback circuit holds the membrane potential at the desired level.
- The voltage clamp technique permits the simultaneous measurement of the current needed to keep the cell at a given voltage.
- This current is equal to the amount of current flowing across the neuronal membrane.
- The voltage clamp technique can indicate how membrane potential influences ion current flow across the membrane.
- The patch clamp technique is a popular contemporary version of the voltage clamp approach.
- It can be applied to virtually any cell and has a resolution high enough to measure the minute electrical currents flowing through single ion channels.
