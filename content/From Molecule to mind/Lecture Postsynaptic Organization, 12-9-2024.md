# Synaptic Genes
- We identify many synaptic genes that are *synaptopathies*
	- These are genes that cause disorders when they are not present or are wrong
	- using [[Neural systems#GWAS|GWAS]] 
	- MUNC18 is essential for synapse function
# The Synapse
## The Pre-Synapse
- Synapses are really dense, packed full of proteins
## Post-synapse
- There are stubby and small post-synaptic regions
	- Smaller are not mature yet --> high plasticity
- 400nm diameterm tickness of 60nm
- 2500 proteins in it
- has (structural) organization
	- it has to, otherwise release transmitter might not align with receptor
	- good reason for organization
	- This is done by attaching the receptors to a scaffold in the post-synapse
		- his is done by the *[[PDZ domain]]*
### [[PDZ domain]]
- PDZ binding allows for interaction with the cytoplasm
	- Binds to c-terminal of the protein
	- done with a hand-like structure
- Many different PSD proteins have these POZ binding domains
	- For example, PSD-95
		- Has three PDZ-domains for protein interaction
		- Has a hydrophobic acyl group (like *[[Lecture Cell Biology 15#G-protein coupled receptors|G-protein]]* ) form membrane attachment
	- N-terminal of PSD-95 can interact with N terminal of other proteins to affect outputs
	- these can bind together at the GK with GKAP to create a scaffold-like structure
		- this fixes the receptors that bind to the *pdz-domains* in place
		- Or bind to CRIPT proteins which bind to the cytoskeleton
- PDZ domains are also present in presynaptic proteins
	- They bind transmembrane proteins, like neoligin and beta-neurexin. These bind together external to the cells, which align the pre- and post-synaptic neuron. 
		- also align the communication machinery

## Protein synthesis in the post-synapse
- Synapses can also translate transcripts into proteins with ribosomes in the cells
- The spine contains a protein synthesis machinery
	- Ribosomes
	- RNA molecules (a few thousand different ones present in the post-synapse)
	- When do they translate RNA to proteins? 
		- If you stimulate the synapse, it tends to transcribe
