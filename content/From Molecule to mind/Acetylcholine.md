## Acetylcholine
- *ACh* was the *first neurotransmitter* to be discovered
- Active in *skeletal muscular junctions* --> [[Neurotransmitters & their release#Quantal Release of Neurotransmitters|discussed here earlier]]
- Also active in the CNS --> we don't know much about that yet
- Synthesized in the *nerve terminal* from Acetyl coenzyme and Choline
- Afterwards, 10,000 molecules are put in a *cholinergic* vesicle 
### Acetylcholine reuptake
- In synapse re-uptake is done by *acetylcholinesterase (AChE)* in *synaptic cleft*
	- Can be taken advantage of by inhibiting AChE (*Organophosphates*)
		- Causes ACh to be built up at synaptic cleft, depolarizing cells --> lethal
		- Insects very sensitive to this --> used in insecticides
### Acetylcholine receptors
- *[[nicotinic ACh receptor figure]] (nAChR)* -> named bc *nicotine* also binds there
	- [[Other types of ion-channel gates#Ligand-Gated Ion Channels|ligand-gated receptor]]
	- *large protein complexes* made out of *five subunits*
		- Two *alpha-subunits* --> binding sites of ACh (two must be bound to activate)
		- Each have a large extracellular domain, and 4 membrane-spanning domains
		-  The transmembrane domains of the five individual subunits together form a channel with a central membrane-spanning pore -> big pore -> thats why the receptor cannot discriminate between many different types of neurotransmitters
- Another type of ACh receptor: *muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs)*
	- Activated by mushroom-made *muscarin*
	- is a [[G-protein]] receptor
