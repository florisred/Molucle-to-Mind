## Genetics
- The nervous system is the product of gene expression
	- Begins at outset of embryogenesis
- Gene comprises of 
	1. Coding DNA sequences, called *exons*
		- Templates for mRNA
			- Again translated into protein
	2. Regulatory DNA sequence, *promotors* and *introns*
		- control which and how much a gene is expressed
			- Genetic analysis important in neuroscience --> genomics
			- *Genomics* focusses on the analysis of complete DNA sequences
- Looking at genome often not enough, and expertise from many areas of related study are needed to understand brain function and disease
## Human genome
- Human genome comprises about *20,000* *genes*
	- *14,000* are expressed in the nervous system
		- *8000* expressed in all cells and tissues
		- *6000* only in nervous system
			- These are mostly in *introns* an *regulatory systems* for things like timing 
			- This seems low, *splice variants* allow one gene to encode multiple different related genes

- Often, severe diseases like *mitosis* and *Huntingtons disease* come from a single mutated gene
	- Realizing this, we can deduce how the disease works through proteins
