## Transcription regulators bind to DNA sequences
- we saw earlier that the [[From DNA to RNA#Promotor & terminator|promoter]] sequence binds *RNA polymerase* 
	- These contain both a *transcription initiation site* and a sequence a little earlier in the code of about 50 base-pairs lets the *RNA polymerase* recognize the promoter sequence, although it does not itself bind *RNA polymerase*
- Genes also have a *regulatory DNA sequence* -> used to switch gene on / off
	- Vary wildly, in bacteria sometimes 10 base pairs, in eukaryotes sometimes 10,000
		- These complex ones act as a *microprocessor*, aggregating many chemical signals
	- These parts are recognized by *transcription regulators* -> their binding acts as switch
	- Pair very weakly with the nucleotides, but since there are sometimes like 20 contact sites, they are very strong while also being very *specific* -> all 20 need to correspond in order to make a good fit
	- Many bind as *dimers* -> doubles the amount of contact
## Transcriptional switches allow cells to respond to changes in the environment
- In simple cells like the bacteria *e.coli*, many genes coding for enzymes related to tryptophan synthesis are all activated by one transcriptional switch (called *operons*) and transcribed as one large mRNA strand
	- These are rare in multicellular organisms or eukaryotes
	- These are very active when *tryptophan* reserves are low, but shut off when it is abundant
		- When a *transcription regulator* binds the operons *operator*, it blocks access of *RNA polymerase* to the gene -> blocking *transcription*
			- This *transcription regulator* is called *tryptophan repressor*, and can only bind with the DNA when it has itself bound many *tryptophan molecules*! Very smart, nature!
### Repressors turn genes off and Activators turn them on
- Like the *tryptophan repressor*, *transcriptional repressors* turn genes off.
- There are also *transcriptional activators*, which active the genes
	- They often have to bind with a second molecule too
	- For example, bacterial activator protein *CAP* has to bind with *cAMP* before it binds dna
		- like [[Protein Kinase 1]] 
### An Activator and a repressor control the Lac operon
- Often a *promoter* is controlled by multiple *transcription regulators*
- Example with the *Lac operon* in *e.coli*
	- Lac operon allows the e.coli bacteria to digest lactose
	- Only activated when *cAMP* binds it (means that there is no glucose) AND when *lactose* is present -> acts as an aggregator of signals, performing logical operations! insane.
- [[example Lac operon]]
## eukaryotic transcription regulators control gene expression from a distance
- Eukaryotes also have these regulators, called *enhancers* ->they increase the rate of transcription 
	- Bind sometimes thousands of nucleotides away from the actual gene, upstream or downstream -> *action at a distance*
		- Seems spooky, but is quite simple. The DNA loops around so that it can affect the gene
		- [[example spooky action at a distance]]
	- Often enabled by *Mediators* -> big protein complexes that link these two creating *transcription complexes*
		- Allow the RNA polymerase to bind more easily --> enhanchers?
- There are also regulators that change the *chromatin* structure -> [[The regulation of Chromosome Structure#Changes in Nucleosome Structure Allow Access to DNA|chromatin]]

### Eukaryotic transcription regulators help initiate transcription by recruiting chromatin-modifying proteins 
- Sometimes changing the chromatin structure can physically bock RNA polymerase from binding
- done by *chromatin-remodeling complexes*  and by enzymes that *covalently modify* the *histone* proteins that form the core of the *nucleosome* 
	- Sometimes they attract *histone deacetylases* -> deacetylates the histones making them less good at gene transcription initiation
