- This was a very fast lecture without much explanation. I copied the most important part of the slides and made quick summaries of the explanation!
# Overview of amino acids

# The four interactions that shape a protein
## Covalent bond
- Connect amino acids
- Strongest interactions that you can find
- Most of the time, there are noncovalent bonds. 
	- Sometime though, there are covalent bonds in the form of disulfide bonds
	- the strongest, need an enzyme to break down again
## Electrostatic attractions
- + and - attract
## Van der Waals attractions
- Weak attraction that bring CH<sub>3</sub> groups together
## Hydrogen bonds
- Use the uneven charge distribution in water atoms 
## Hydrophobic interactions
- If there are hydrophobic parts of an unfolded protein, they will form a hydrophobic core in the middle, with nonpolar side-chains ![[Pasted image 20240916103101.png|400]]
- If there are hydrophobic side chains on the outside, the protein probably goes in the membrane
- Or, there are stripes of hydrophobic side chains on a protein
	- They can attract each other, and wrap around each other![[Pasted image 20240916103739.png|300]]
	- can form the *SNARE-complex*![[Pasted image 20240916103814.png|400]]]


# Ligand-receptor binding
- A ligand fits in a receptor protein very perfectly using non-covalent bonds
	- That is good, because you need enzymes to separate them again which is impractical in a receptor ![[Pasted image 20240916104326.png|500]]
	- Even though in an unfolded protein the specific amino acids are distant, they are close in a folded structure, which allows it to fit the ligand perfectly
# Feedback mechanisms
- Often very complex, but the basics are this![[Pasted image 20240916104605.png|300]]
# Enzymes
- Molecules bind to active enzymes, which can de-activate the enzyme![[Pasted image 20240916104826.png]]
- Activity is never 0%, as it is a stochastic process
# Phosphorylation
- One of the most drastic ways to change binding and structure of enzymes![[Pasted image 20240916105018.png|300]]
