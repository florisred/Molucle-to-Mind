## What are they?
- Molecules whose release is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in cell 
- Not stored in vesicles
- not released from presynaptic terminals via exocytotic mechanisms
- Often involved in *retrograde signaling*
	- From *post* to *pre-synaptic terminal*

### Endocannabinoids
- They activate receptors targeted by *THC* (the stoner chemical)
- Still a lot needs to be discovered about them
- Examples of endocannabinoids:
	- 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), created out of degraded membrane lipids
	- Therefore they can pass the cell membrane (hydrophobic) and act as second messenger
- In the hippocampus and cerebellum, they serve as retrograde signal regulating GABA release
	- *inhibiting the inhibitory GABA signal*!
### Nitrous Oxide (NO)
- Gas produced by nitric *oxide synthase*
- Can permeate cell membrane also -> can affect nearby cells before is degraded
	- Great for coordinating many cells together
- Considered a *Second messenger*
- Degrades spontaneously when reacting with oxygen
