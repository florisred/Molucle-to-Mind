## CSF
- Produced bij *choroid plexus* -> derivative of wall/roof of the neural tube with enriched blood supply
	- produce 500ml/day into the ventricles -> a lot, as we only have 125ml capacity
		- Disturbance of drainage as a child leads to hydrocephalus (waterhoofd)
		- Drainage goes through the *arachnoid granulations*
	- flows from the lateral ventricles via *interventricular forman of monroe* into the 3rd ventricle
