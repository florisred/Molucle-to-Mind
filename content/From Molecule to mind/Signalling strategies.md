## Strategies of molecular signaling
- Molecular signaling mediates and controls *all* brain function
- We have seen [[Action potentials]] before, but there are more
- *Paracrine*: acts over a longer range than synaptic transmission and involves the secretion of chemical signals onto a group of nearby target cell
- *Endocrine signaling*: secretion of hormones into the bloodstream
- They all require three components:
	- *signal*, *receptor*, and the *effector*
	- Receptors often *transduce* the signal (electric -> chemical, sound -> electric, etc.)
- *Signal amplification*: From one or few signals to many to bring about large changes
	- individual signaling reactions can generate a much larger number of molecular products
	- [[Amplification in signal transduction example]]
- This *amplification* can take different amounts of time depending on the kind of signal, leading to more precise control of how and when signals arrive and are processed.
## Activation of signaling pathways
- Always activated by one signaling molecule, can be one of *three* classes
### Cell-impermeant 
- secreted molecules -> can act on target cells removed from the site of signal synthesis or release
- cannot traverse the cell membrane -> binds extracellularly to receptors
- *peptide hormones*
- *reproductive hormones*
### Cell-permeant
- secreted molecules -> can act on target cells removed from the site of signal synthesis or release
-  are able to cross the plasma membrane and bind to receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus of target cells
- *steroid hormones* (glucocorticoids, estradiol, and testosterone)
- *thyroid hormones* (thyroxin), and 
- *retinoids*.
### Cell-associated signaling molecules
- bind to receptors associated with the plasma membrane.
- They lay on one cell membrane, and signal to receptors on another cell's membrane
- presented on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. 
	- These signals activate receptors on target cells only if they are directly adjacent to the signaling cell.
