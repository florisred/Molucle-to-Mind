## Principal second messengers: [[Neural second messengers]]
### Calcium
- Ca<sup>2+</sup> is probably the most common signal in neurons
- Caused by a higher concentration of calcium in the *cytoplasm*, allowing more to bind
- For example bind to *calmodulin*
	- First activates the calmodulin, in turn binds to protein kinases, activating them
- *Synaptotagmin* also binds Ca<sup>2+</sup>, allowing vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane
- Calcium concentrations in the brain are orders of magnitude lower than in the bloodstream
	- maintained by an *ATPase* called the *calcium pump* and *an Na+/Ca2+ exchanger*, which is a protein that replaces intracellular Ca 2+ with extracellular sodium ions->[[Active transporters]]
	- Also pumped in the *mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum* -> large C<sup>2+</sup> deposits
	- Also bound to *cal-bindin*, which acts as a calcium buffer in neural cells
### Cyclic nucleotides
- Important group of second messengers
- *cAMP* -> cyclic adenosine monophosphate
	- Derivative of *ATP*
	- produced when [[Receptors#G-Protein|G-protein]] activates adenylyl cyclase in the plasma membrane.
- *cGMP* -> cyclic guanosine monophosphate 
	- From *GTP*
- They often target *protein kinases* -> phosphorilate proteins
### Diacylglycerol and IP<sub>3</sub>
- From cell membrane lipids
- - _Membrane lipids_ can be converted into intracellular second messengers
    - _Phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP₂)_ is cleaved by _phospholipase C_ (activated by G-proteins and calcium ions) into two key second messengers:
        - _Diacylglycerol (DAG)_: stays in the membrane and activates _protein kinase C_, which phosphorylates substrate proteins
        - _Inositol trisphosphate (IP₃)_: diffuses into the cytosol and binds to IP₃ receptors, releasing calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum
            - This calcium release triggers a variety of cellular reactions (could be seen as a _third messenger_)
- The actions of _DAG_ and _IP₃_ are terminated by enzymes that convert them back into inactive forms, allowing them to be recycled into _PIP₂_
## Second-Messenger Signaling via Protein Phosphorylation
- Phosphorylation is a post-translational modification
- Proteins are phosphorylated by *protein kinases*, and de-phosphorylated by *phosphatases*.
- 3% of the human genome is dedicated to these!!!!
- It serves to *integrate* many inputs -> many different signals lead to (de)phosphorylation
### Protein kinases
- Regulated by *second messengers* or *extracellular signals*
	-  second messengers activate Ser or Thr kinases, whereas extracellular signals activate Tyr kinases
	- They have a *regulatory site* aside from their *catalytic site* where the second messengers bind
#### cAMP-dependent protein kinase -> PKA
- *PKA* is the primary effector of cAMP action in neurons and consists of two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits
	- When *cAMP* binds to the different subunits, *PKA* is activated
	- Can phosphorylate many different types of protein, but is selective due to distinct amino acids blocking binding or using *anchoring proteins*
#### Ca<sup>2+</sup> or *calmodulin*-dependent protein kinase
- Important in [[Lecture Ch.8 Memory#Long-term potentiation in hippocampus|memory]] and [[Neurotransmitters & their release#Molecular mechanisms of Synaptic Vesicle Cycling|vesicle release]]
- Comprises *12 subunits* connected on a wheel-like structure
	- all have both regulatory and catalytic structure. Bind together when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is low, inhibiting it
- With higher calcium concentration, the catalytic domains are disinhibited and the enzyme starts enzyming -> *phosphorylate substrate proteins*
- Some CaMKII can auto-phosphorylate, keeping the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal alive way after it has subsided. This is thought to play a role in cellular memory before *Long term potentiation happens*
#### Other protein kinases
- *Protein Kinase C* (PKC)
	-  monomeric kinases activated by the second messengers *DAG* and Ca<sup>2+</sup>
	- Diffuses through the membrane -> even to the cytoskeleton
	- Sustained PKC activation is thought to play a role in tumor development
- *Protein tyrosine kinases*
	- Transfer phosphate to tyrosine, as the name implies
- *Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). MAPKs*
	- MAPKs are inactive at rest but become activated when they are phosphorylated
	- Often in kinase cascades with many signals
### Protein phosphatases
- also consist of catalytic and regulatory subunits
- **Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)**:
    - A dimer composed of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit.
    - Regulated by various regulatory subunits and is involved in dephosphorylating a wide range of proteins, influencing processes like neuronal signaling and metabolism.
- **Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A)**:
    - One of the most abundant enzymes in the brain, consisting of multiple subunits that allow for various combinations and functions.
    - Plays a significant role in dephosphorylating proteins like tau, linking it to neurodegenerative diseases and various cellular processes.
- **Protein Phosphatase 2B (PP2B)**:
    - Also known as calcineurin, is activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin signaling.
    - Involved in diverse signaling pathways and can influence processes like synaptic plasticity.
