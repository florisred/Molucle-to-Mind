## Principal second messengers:
### Calcium
- Ca<sup>2+</sup> is probably the most common signal in neurons
- Caused by a higher concentration of calcium in the *cytoplasm*, allowing more to bind
- For example bind to *calmodulin*
	- First activates the calmodulin, in turn binds to protein kinases, activating them
- *Synaptotagmin* also binds Ca<sup>2+</sup>, allowing vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane
- Calcium concentrations in the brain are orders of magnitude lower than in the bloodstream
	- maintained by an *ATPase* called the *calcium pump* and *an Na+/Ca2+ exchanger*, which is a protein that replaces intracellular Ca 2+ with extracellular sodium ions->[[Active transporters]]
	- Also pumped in the *mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum* -> large C<sup>2+</sup> deposits
	- Also bound to *cal-bindin*, which acts as a calcium buffer in neural cells
