## [[NMDA receptor]]
- It is the *coincidence detector* required for [[Long-Term Potentiation at a Hippocampal Synapse#What is required for LTP to happen?|LTP to happen]]
- It lies in the postsynaptic membrane
- At the *resting potential*, the *NMDA receptor* is blocked by Mg<sup>2+</sup>
	- When depolarized only sometimes, this stays the case and the EPSP is done directly by the *AMPA receptor*
	- When it is *depolarized* repeatedly and quickly, the potential membrane becomes positive, and these forces release the Mg<sup>2+</sup>
		- it then allows Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter the cell using the *concentration gradient*
- This accounts for the *coincidence detector*, and *synapse-specifity* for LTP
	- *associativity* also arises, through *associative depolarization* 
- Therefore, it stands to reason that LTP happens through higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the *postsynaptic membrane*
## How then does LTP come about?
- The Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes the *AMPA* receptors 
	- This has to do with [[synbio 4-5, functional genomics of the synapse|synaptotagmins]]
- The LTP has nothing to do with an increased amount of *NMDA receptors* -> they don't *express LTP*
	- They just start the process of LTP, the AMPA receptors express it
	- Like having more *AMPA* receptors due to the LTP
- Means that they postsynaptic cell is more sensitive to *glutamate*!
- Aside from *synaptotagmins*, [[Lecture Ch.8 Memory#Long-term potentiation in hippocampus|CaMKII]] is also important as deletion of CamKII prevents LTP
	- CaMKII can *autophosphorylate*, so that probably allows the signal to stay on while the LTP changes are being made? Again, even the book does not even know, so summarizing this is hard. I think if you just kinda know what does what you should be okay! 
- Here is an [[example showing the entire LTP process]], I think if you understand whats going on here you are good!
