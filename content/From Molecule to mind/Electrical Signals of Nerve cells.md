# Electrical signals
## How are they measured?
- With *micro-electrodes*, usually small glass tubes filled with an electrical conductor
	- Hooked up to a voltmeter or computer
	- Normally, the nerve cells have a **negative potential** --> *resting membrane potential*
		- -40mV to -90mV depending on the cell
## [[Types of potentials]]
- Resting membrane potential
- *Receptor potential*  
	- change in voltage due to activation of sensory neurons by external stimuli\
- *Synaptic potential*
	- Potentials in *synapses*
- *[[Neurons#Action potentials|Action potentials]]*
### [[Action potentials]]
- Axons are terrible passive conductors as they leak current
	- so **action potentials** are used as a booster system
- spikes / impulses of electronic potential
- travel along axons to carry information
- *Hyper-polarization*
	- if they are **More negative**, they become *hyper-polarized* 
	- Do not require any neuron-specific property --> **Passive electrical response**
- *Depolarization*:
	- less negative until it reaches the *threshold potential*
	- after this, an *action potential* is reached
- Takes about **1ms**
- All or none principle
	- The Amplitude of the AP does not matter
	- Intensity of a stimulus is given by the **frequency** of Action potentials
- Caused by selective **Changes in permeability**
