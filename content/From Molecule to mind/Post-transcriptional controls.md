## What are they?
- After transcription has taken place (and thus a lot of regulatory control has already been done), even more can be controlled using *post-transcriptional controls*
- We have already seen this in *RNA splicing* in [[From DNA to RNA#Introns|introns]]

## Each mRNA controls its own degradation and translation
- The longer [[From DNA to RNA#RNA|RNA]] exists, the more protein it will produce
	- In bacteria, RNA lasts only a few minutes -> quick adaptation
- In eukaryotes, it lasts generally longer (like 30 minutes) but sometimes the half life is 10 hours (hemoglobin)
- Its lifetime is specified by *nucleotide sequences* within the *untranslated regions* that lie both upstream and downstream of the protein-coding sequence
	- These are places where mRNA-degrading enzymes bind
- Each mRNA also contains sequences affecting degradation time
### In bacteria:
- Bacterial _mRNAs_ contain a short _ribosome-binding sequence_ located just upstream of the AUG codon
    - This sequence forms base pairs with the RNA in the _small ribosomal subunit_ to position the AUG codon correctly
    - Efficient translation initiation depends on this interaction
- The bacterium can control translation by blocking or exposing this ribosome-binding sequence
    - Blocking it inhibits translation, while exposing it promotes translation
### In eukaryotes:
- eukaryotic mRNA has a 5' cap guiding ribosomes to the AUG [[From RNA to Protein#Codons|codon]]
- Eurkaryotic repressor proteins bind at untranslated 5' region block ribosomes from finding the AUG
	- inhibiting translation
## Regulatory RNA
### MicroRNA (miRNA)
- Tiny RNA molecules that bind with RNA through base-pairs
	- reduces both stability and transcription
	- regulate 1/3 of all genes
- only about 22 nucleotides in length
- packed with proteins into a *RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)*
	- looks for  mRNAs that are complementary to the bound miRNA molecule
		- Can disable a *whole set of mRNA* which contain the right sequence
	- When it binds, it either destroys mRNA or blocks it
### small interfering RNAs Are produced from double stranded, foreign RNAs to protect cells from infections
- *RNA Interference (RNAi):* the system used to eliminate *foreign* RNA (from viruses etc)
	- Mostly eliminates *double-stranded RNA*
	- First cut up in short fragments of 22 nucleotides by a *Dicer*
	- Results in small, double stranded RNA -> *small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)*
		- Also taken up by the *RISC*, which uses one strand to find other similar foreign RNA
- This is a very old mechanism, found in a lot of cells
### Thousands of long noncoding RNAs may Also regulate mammalian gene Activity
- There are probably over *8000* *long non-coding sequences of 200+ nucleotides* that also regulate
- they are pretty much entirely not understood yet.
- The Xist molecule is over 17,000 nucleotides long and disables a
