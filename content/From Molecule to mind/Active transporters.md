# What are they?
- All of the discussion on ion channels and messaging relies on the fact that ion concentration gradients are maintained well. 
	- Na+, K+ , Cl – , H+ , and Ca 2+ are all in *electrochemical equilibrium*
- Since they are used for signaling, you would expect the ions to be gradually dispersed --> does not happen
- So, this is done by *active transporters*
	- **Consume energy** while transporting ions against the electrochemical equilibrium
- Active transporters form *complexes* with the ions they are translocating
	- Takes milliseconds, a lot slower than ion channels
 - Two main types of active transporters: *ATPase pumps* and *ion exchangers*
# ATPase pumps
- **Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump**:
    - Key in maintaining Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> transmembrane gradients.
    - Made of two subunits: α (translocates ions, spans membrane 10 times) and β (spans once).
    - Fueled by ATP; 3 Na<sup>+</sup> out, 2 K<sup>+</sup> in for each cycle.
    - Uses ATP binding and phosphorylation to alternate ion transport, preventing ion leakage.
    - Crucial for brain function, consuming about two-thirds of brain energy.
- **Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase pumps**:
    - Remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> from cells, preventing excess buildup.
    - Two types: **PMCA** (in the plasma membrane) and **SERCA** (stores Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the ER).
    - Similar structure to Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump but with Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites.
- Historical research showed ATP is necessary for the Na<sup>+</sup> pump's function, with early studies proving ATP-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> efflux and K<sup>+</sup> influx.
# Exchangers (Ion Transporters)
- **Do not use ATP directly** but instead rely on the electrochemical gradients of other ions for energy.
    - Ions are exchanged: one ion is moved **up** its gradient while another (often Na<sup>+</sup>) moves **down** its gradient.
    - The Na<sup>+</sup> gradient ultimately depends on ATPase pumps like the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase.
- **Antiporters** exchange ions in **opposite directions**:
    - **Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger**: keeps intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> low.
    - **Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger**: regulates intracellular pH.
- **Co-transporters** move multiple ions in the **same direction**:
    - Regulate intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> by translocating Cl<sup>-</sup> with Na<sup>+</sup> and/or K<sup>+</sup>.
