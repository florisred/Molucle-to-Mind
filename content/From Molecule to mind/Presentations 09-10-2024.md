# Hippocampus
## Limbic system
- Regulates behavioral and emotional responses
- 6 Components:
	- Cingulate gyrus -> learning, memory, emotion
	- Basal ganglia -> dopaminergic neurons for movement & reward
	- Mediodorsal Thalamic nuclei -> memory, attention, planning
	- *hippocampus* ->  memory and spacial naviation
	- Amygdala -> pleasure, fear, angerm anxiety
	- Hypothalamus, mood regulation & HPA axis
## Hippocampal formation
- Projects upwards to limbic system
- Dentate gyrus is at the 'bottom' of the hippocampus
	- Mostly to do with memory formation & depression
- Subiculum
	- entry and exit of perforant pathway -> indirect
- Cornu ammonis
	- Declarative memory, spatial orientation, navigation
- Connection hippocampus & amygdala is small but very important!
### Papez circuit and neuroendocrine control
- Hippocampus -> negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis
- Papez circuit -> interconnects hippocampus & hypothalamus
	- Subiculum, fornix, and mammilary bodies
### Hippocampus internal structure
#### Cell layers in hippocampus proper
- CA1-CA3
	1. Molecular layer - dendrites -> inputs
	2. Pyramidal cell layer -> cell bodies
	3. Polymorphic layer -> Schaffer collaterals
- Place cells!
#### Cell layers of Dentate Gyrus
1. Molecular layer - dendrites -> inputs
2. Granular layer - cell bodies -> G
3. Polymorphic layer - mossy fibers -> P
### Trisynaptic circuit of the hippocampus
- Entorhinal cortex -> dentate gyrus -> mossy fibres -> CA 1 -> subiculum -> entorhinal cortex
- You can look at it like processing the signal and sending it back
	- For [[Memory in the brain#Long term potentiation|LTP]]
## Parahippocampal Cortex
- Contributes to associative and visuospatial processing and memory
	- Paralinguistic communication -> body language, posture
- But there is a lot unknown
- Projects to inferior longitudinal fasiculus
	- For complex visual processing
- And to cingula -> memory integration of visual shit
## Entorhinal cortex
- Main input of the hippocampus -> runs alongside the hippocampus
- Direct connections from olfactory epithelium to the hippocampus
	- Thats why smells always be making me remember
- Indirect pathway:
	- EC -> DG -> CA3 -: CA1
- Direct :(
- [[Lecture Ch.30 Cognitive Map and Memory#Cognitive maps in the hippocampal formation|hexonal stable grid cells]]
	- On the most dorsal: Finer, smaller grid
	- On the most ventral: Bigger, cruder grid
## Hippocampus pathologies
- [[Alzheimer's Disease]]
- [[Depression]]
- Temporal lobe [[Epilepsy]]
### Gut microbiota composition:
- Can influence brain function & behavior
- Changes in metabolites can maintain epileptic activity
	- So targeting microbiota could help with epilepsy

# Amygdala
## Overview
- Point out where the amygdala is in different views of the brain
- Know the input and output pathways
- THe three amygdlaar nuclei and their specific funtion
- Know the general functions
- And know what defects might be
## Anatomy
- Small, almond-shaped structure
- Part of the limbic system -> emotional processing and fear processing
- Formation & consolidation of memeory
### Where is the amygdala?
- Lateral to the Uncus
- Rostral to the hippocampus
## Amygdalar nuclei
- There are three different nuclei in the amygdala, you can find them with their names
- Central group, Medial group, Basalateral group
	- Know this due to staining
### Input
- Amygdala receives
	- regulatory info from prefrontal cortex
	- Social-emotional 
### Output
- Orbitofrontal & cingulate cortex -> social and emotional behavior
- Sensory cortex -> emotional coloring
- Hippocampus -> memory
- Hypothalamus and brainstem -> autonomous emotional responses and arousal
### Corticomedial nuclei
- Directly involved with olfaction
- Generating innate response to chemo-signals
- Social, reproductive, and defensive behavior
- Receptors for oxytocin, estrogen, and dopamine
	- When you block dopamine with optogenics, the mice were not scared at all!
### Basolateral Nuclei
- Largest amygdala group
- Conditioning of emotions
- Activated during anxiety
- Consists of three subnuclei -> not very important
	- Lateral nucleus
	- Basal nucleis
	- Basomedial nucleus
- Connects with hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex
### Central nucleus
- *integrative hub*
- Basolateral amygdala -> central nucleus -> hypothalamus -> (inhibitory) HPA -> prefrontal cortex

## Function of amygdala
- Threat detection
- Fight and flight response
	- Recognizes threat, and then communicates with hypothalamus -> stress hormones released
		- Really fast pathway -> happens before you realize it
	- Irrational fears (like public speaking) -> amygdala *hijack*
		- It is connected to the PFC, and when it is overstimulated you get an amygdala *hijack*
- Amygdala is also activated upon intense emotions -> thats why you remember them better
- Also helps facial recognition

# Announcements!
- This year the presentations were very good!
- Next week, practice exam. Anatomy 40 questions (all multiple choice)
- So, go through all the slides
