- We already know that cells generate electrical signals by virtue of an *ion-specific differentially permeable membrane*.
	- The increase in Na+ permeability triggers the [[Action potentials]]
		- If we know why the membrane changes in permeability, we can understand action potentials better.
- It became possible to study due to the *[[Voltage clamp method]]*
	- Allows experimenters to control the membrane potential and measure the permeability changes
## Two types of voltage-dependent ion currents
- No real ion currents flow at membrane potentials more negative than the resting potential. 
	- This changes when the potential is higher than the resting potential, as the current starts flowing an changes in magnitude. this is due to *early current* and *late current*
###  1. *Early current* is caused by the rushing of Na+ inside the cell
- tested by removing Na+ from the outside of the cell. This makes Ena more negative; as soon as the membrane is more permeable, current should flow outward as Na+ leaves the neuron
### 2.  *Late current*, caused by K+ exiting the neuron.
- Taken together, these experiments show that changing the membrane potential to a level more positive than the resting potential produces two effects: an early influx of Na+ into the neuron, followed by a delayed efflux of K+
	- The early influx of Na+ produces a transient inward current, whereas the delayed efflux of K+ produces a sustained out-ward current
- We now know that the permeability is done by [[Ion channels]]
