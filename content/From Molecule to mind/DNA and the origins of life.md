ill do this later if i have time as it did not seem relevant to neuroscience rn.
• From our knowledge of present-day organisms and the molecules
they contain, it seems likely that life on Earth began with the evolu-
tion of RNA molecules that could catalyze their own replication.
• It has been proposed that RNA served as both the genome and the
catalysts in the first cells, before DNA replaced RNA as a more stable
molecule for storing genetic information, and proteins replaced RNAs
as the major catalytic and structural components. RNA catalysts in
modern cells are thought to provide a glimpse into an ancient, RNA-
based world.
