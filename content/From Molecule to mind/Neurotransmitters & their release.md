## Properties of Neurotransmitters
- *acetylcholine* (ACh) acts in the heart and neuromuscular junction of striated muscles and in the visceral motor system
- Over 100 neurotransmitters have been identified
	- small-molecule neurotransmitters, such as ACh, and neuropeptides
	- Having multiple allows for specific and complex signals
- *small-molecule neurotransmitters* mediate *rapid* synaptic actions, whereas *neuropeptides* tend to modulate *slower*, ongoing neuronal functions
- Sometimes, neurons release multiple molecules (*co-transmitters*)
- *Neurotransmitters* need to be regulated precisely
	- *Small-molecule neurotransmitters* are synthesized *locally* within presynaptic terminals
		- The precursor molecules required to make new molecules of neurotransmitter are usually taken into the nerve terminal by transporters found in the plasma membrane of the terminal 
		- When put in vesicles, they are called: *small clear-core vesicles*
	- *Neuropeptides* are synthesized in the cell body of a neuron
		- Peptide-filled vesicles are brought to the synapse: *Axonal transport*
		- When put in vesicles, they are called: *large dense-core vesicles*

## Release of neurotransmittors
## Quantal Release of Neurotransmitters
- Much of the early info came from study of *neuromuscular junctions*
	- Synapses there have *end plates* --> create *EPP*, End Plate Potential.
		- large enough to bring the membrane potential of the muscle cell well above the threshold
	- There are also spontaneous small potentials, of 1mV 
		- These are *miniature end plate potentials*, or *MEPPs*
- **EPP Magnitude as Neurotransmitter Assay:** EPP magnitude reflects neurotransmitter secretion from motor neuron terminals.
- **EPP Measurement Challenges:** Measuring EPPs requires preventing muscle contraction, typically achieved by reducing Ca2+ concentration or blocking ACh receptors.
- **Quantum Fluctuations in EPPs:** EPPs consist of individual units (MEPPs) released in a quantal manner, as evidenced by fluctuations in EPP amplitude and increments in units similar to MEPPs.
### From synaptic vesicles
- Vesicles are the source of these *quanta*
### Local Recycling of Synaptic Vesicles
- The vesicles *fuse* with the synapse membrane when they release the neurotransmitters
	- This causes the cell membrane to expand --> less *tension* --> this was measured
	- *Endocytosis*: Cell membrane is reclaimed to make new vesicles
	- Part of the *[[synaptic vesicle cycle]]*
	- The vesicles and its parts are *recycled*, but originally come from cell body, endoplasmic reticulum etc.
### Calcium & transmitter secretion
- lowering the *concentration* of Ca 2+ outside a presynaptic motor nerve terminal reduces the size of the *EPP*
	- This is because *fewer vesicles* fuse with the membrane
- *Ca2+ is a second messenger* -> Ca2+ regulates how many vesicles fuse
	- A rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is both necessary and sufficient for neurotransmitter release
	- We DO NOT YET KNOW WHY OR HOW!??!
#### Molecular mechanisms of Synaptic Vesicle Cycling
- Might have something to do with *synapsin*, which reversibly binds to synaptic vesicles
	- Can by *phosphorylated* by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cal-modulin-dependent protein kinase, type II
	- Makes it dissociate from the vesicles
- It might just be easier to look at [[example vesicle recycling|this]], as writing it down doesn't make it very clear
- It is unclear how exactly the increase in _Ca<sup>2+</sup>_ concentration triggers vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.
- Many proteins on _synaptic vesicles_ and their binding partners in the _presynaptic plasma membrane_ participate in the _synaptic vesicle cycle_.
- _Synapsin_ binds reversibly to synaptic vesicles and tethers them within the _reserve pool_ by cross-linking vesicles.
    - _Phosphorylation_ of _synapsin_ by _CaMKII_ causes it to dissociate from vesicles, allowing vesicles to move to the _plasma membrane_.
- Vesicles are attached to the membrane through _docking_ reactions involving _SNARE proteins_.
    - The _SNARE complex_ brings the two membranes close, promoting fusion.
    - _Toxins_ that cleave _SNARE proteins_ block neurotransmitter release, confirming the role of _SNAREs_ in vesicle fusion.
    - Experiments with artificial membranes have shown that _SNARE complexes_ facilitate membrane fusion.
- Although _SNARE proteins_ do not bind _Ca<sup>2+</sup>_, other molecules, such as _synaptotagmins_, regulate     _Ca<sup>2+</sup>_ for neurotransmitter release.
    - _Synaptotagmins_ bind _Ca<sup>2+</sup>_ and facilitate vesicle fusion.
- Proteins like _NSF_ and _SNAPs_ assist in priming vesicles for fusion by organizing _SNARE proteins_ into the correct configuration.
    - Other proteins, such as _munc13_, _munc18_, _complexin_, and _syntaxin_, also interact with _SNAREs_ to ensure proper vesicle priming.
- _Synaptotagmin_ acts as a _Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor_, binding _Ca<sup>2+</sup>_ at concentrations required for vesicle fusion.
    - When _Ca<sup>2+</sup>_ binds, _synaptotagmin_ changes its chemical properties, allowing it to insert into the plasma membrane, causing membrane curvature and promoting fusion.
    - Disruption of _synaptotagmin_ in animals, like mice or squid, impairs _Ca<sup>2+</sup>_-dependent neurotransmitter release, and deletion of certain _synaptotagmin_ genes is lethal in mice.
- _SNARE proteins_ bring the vesicle and plasma membranes close together, while _Ca<sup>2+</sup>_-triggered changes in _synaptotagmin_ finalize the membrane fusion.
#### Endocytosis and Vesicle Recycling
- _Clathrin_, with its unique _triskelion_ structure, coats vesicles for endocytosis, forming a cage-like structure around the vesicle membrane.
    - _Adaptor proteins_ like _AP-2_ and _AP-180_ help connect _clathrin_ to vesicle membrane proteins and lipids.
    - Other proteins like _amphiphysin_, _epsin_, and _Eps-15_ aid in assembling the clathrin structure, creating _coated pits_ for vesicle budding.
- _Dynamin_ forms a ring around the vesicle’s lipid stalk and pinches off the membrane to complete vesicle formation.
    - Afterward, _clathrin coats_ are removed by the ATPase _Hsc70_ with the help of the co-factor _auxilin_, and the vesicle is uncoated by proteins like _synaptojanin_.
- Once uncoated, vesicles are refilled with neurotransmitter through vesicle _transporters_, which exchange protons for neurotransmitters. The vesicle’s acidic interior is maintained by a proton pump.
- This coordinated molecular process allows for precise and rapid neurotransmitter release, playing a critical role in brain function and synaptic transmission.
