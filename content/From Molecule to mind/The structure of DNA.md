## DNA Consists of Two Complementary Chains of Nucleotides
- *DNA*, or *deoxyribonucleic acid* consists of two long polynucleotide chains
	- Each chain is comprised of four different subunits
	- Hydrogen bonds between the base portions of the *nucleotides* hold the two strains together
	- *nucleotides* are composed of a *nitrogen-containing base* and a *five-carbon sugar*, with one or more *phosphate* groups attached
	- For the nucleotides in DNA, the sugar is *deoxyribose* --> deoxyribonucleic acid
	- Base can be: *adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T)*
		- A always pairs with T, C with G
		- They are covalently bound to sugars & phosphates
		- A *purine* (two-ring base) always pairs with a *pyrimidine* (single ring)
			- On of these is called a *base pair*
- The way in which the nucleotide subunits are linked gives a DNA strand a *chemical polarity*
	- At the ends of the DNA, you will have one *3’ hydroxyl* and one *5’ phosphate group* per strand
	- This is the way the ends and the strands are denoted
- Each *base pair* has an equal width
	- Each *base pair* can fit together within the double helix because the two strands of the helix run antiparallel to each other
- The sugar-phosphate strands then conform in their energetically most favorable conformation: a double helix
## The structure of DNA allows for heritability
- Each base (A, C, T, or G) can be seen as a letter in a genetic 4-letter alphabet
	- The differences in this letter sequence make the differences across and in between species
	- These letters spell out the "recipes" for the proteins --> See:  [[How proteins work]]
		- *Gene expression*: When this code is transcribed into RNA and then translated into proteins
- The amount of words in this genetic 'text' is about 800,000 pages long, so how do nuclei fit so much info in such a little space?
