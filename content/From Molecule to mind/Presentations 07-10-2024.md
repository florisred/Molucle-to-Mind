# Basal Ganglia
- position in the brain
	- Subcortical, on top of midbrain
- Basic functions:
	- Weighing and relaying cortical inputs
	- crucial for motor functions
	- basically a giant integrator
## What are the components of the basal ganglia
### Anatomy central part of the brain
- Lateral to the lateral ventricle
	- Caudate nucleus -> looks like a c
- Connected to caudate nucleus is the putamen
- Corpus callosum:
	- Superior to fornix, medial to lateral aventricle
## What are the functional circuits and pathways
### Motor loop
- For voluntary movement
- Input from motor and sensitive cortices
- Wanted movements are facilitated through the direct pathway
- Competing movements are inhibited through the indirect pathway
### Association loop
- When learning new movements
- Input from higher cortical areas
- Caudate nucleus involved -> a lot of dopaminergic neurons
### Limbic circuit
- Links basal ganglia to emotional centers of the brain
## Direct pathway
- Facilitates movement
- More excitation going to the cortex
- Stimulation from the cortex (motor areas) -> go into striatum
- Disinhibition of the thalamus
### Indirect pathway
- Disinhibition of the subthalamic nucleus
