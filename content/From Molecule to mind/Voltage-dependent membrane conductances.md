# Voltage-dependent membrane conductances
## How it works
- Closely related but not the same as membrane permeability![[Pasted image 20240916164841.png|200]]
	where I<sub>ion</sub> is the ion current, Vm is the membrane potential, and E<sub>ion</sub> is the equilibrium potential for the ion flowing through the conductance, g<sub>ion</sub> . The difference between V<sub>m</sub> and E<sub>ion</sub> is the electrochemical driving force acting on the ion.
	- So, if you know the ion concentrations and have a [[Voltage clamp method|voltage clamp]] to set V<sub>m</sub>, we can calculate g<sub>Na</sub> and g<sub>K</sub>.
		- It turns out that they **change over time.**
		- K<sup>+</sup> conductance takes several milliseconds to adjust. 
		- Na<sup>+</sup> displays *inactivation* --> this has been discussed readily in [[Ion movements, potentials, and electrical signals#Action Potentials and ions|the previous chapter]]
	- Both [[conductances of K+ and N+]] increase progressively as the neuron is depolarized. 
- *Hodgkin and Huxley* figured all of this out with the voltage clamp and made a very precise mathematical model of the action potential --> could even show the *refractory period*
