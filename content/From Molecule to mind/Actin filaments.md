## What are actin filaments?
- *Actin filaments* are polymers of protein *actin*
- Crucial for many cell movements involving cell surface
	- Like phagocytosis, crawling, etc
- *Actin-binding proteins* stabilize the actin filaments, because they are also unstable
- Form different stable structures, like *microvilli* in the gut or *contractile bundles* acting like tiny muscles
- Form different temporary structures, like *dynamic protrusions* in a crawling cell, or *contractile ring* that divides the plasma membrane
## actin filaments are thin and flexible
- They are about 7nm in diameter, and are twisted chains of *globular actin monomers*, pointing in the same direction -> also has a *plus* and a *minus* end
	- Thinner, more flexible, and shorter than [[Microtubules]]
## actin and tubulin Polymerize by similar mechanisms
- Can grow at either end, but plus end is again faster
- Normally it is inherently unstable, unless bound by associated proteins
- Also carries ATP, which also hydrolyses, also making it less stable
- At high concentrations of actin monomers, actin filament will grow rapidly
- at medium concentrations
	- The plus end grows faster than ATP can be hydrolized, so it grows
	- The minus end loses actin, which then is added to the plus end
	- the process of moving like this is called *treadmilling*
## many Proteins bind to actin and modify its Properties
- About 5% of total protein in a cell is *actin*, half of it in filaments and half in the cytosol, enough for spontaneous formation
	- But, *thymosin* and *profilin* bind to actin monomers in the cytosol, preventing them from forming filaments
	- This is *actin regulation*
### actin-binding proteins
- bind to the assembled actin filaments rather then to monomers
	- Some hold actin filaments together in *microvilli*
	- Some create the gell like meshwork within the *cell cortex*
		- *cell cortex*: just beneath the plasma membrane
#### a cortex rich in actin filaments underlies the Plasma membrane of most eukaryotic cells
- Called the *cell cortex*, actin binding proteins link together *actin filaments* just beneath the plasma membrane, giving *mechanical strength* or shape (that's how red blood cells look like that)
#### [[cell crawling]] depends on cortical actin
- many cells move by crawling over surfaces, rather than by swimming
	- White blood cells known as *neutrophils* migrate out of blood into infected tissues after *'smelling'* bacteria
- Three processes do this, all done by *actin*
	1. cell pushes out *protrusions* at its front
		- done by actin polymerization by extending thin, sheetlike *lamellipodia* and even thinner *filopodia*, while at the beginning disassembling, moving them forward
	2. These adhere to surface on which the cell is crawling
		- these two stick to a good surface, using *integrins* on the plasma membrane
	3. the rest of the cell drags itself forward
### Actin associates with myosin to form contractile structures
- Actin dependent motor proteins belong to the *myosin* family
	- Bind to and hydrolyze ATP, which pushes them towards the *plus end* of the actin
- *Mysosin 1*: present in all types of cells, more simple
	- Have a head domain and a tail that varies depending on cargo
		- Head binds to actin and hydrolyzes ATP for movement
- *Myosin 2*: present in *muscle cells*
### Extracellular signals alter the arrangement of Actin filaments
- A lot of proteins modulate *actin* activity
	- These are in fact controlled by extracellular signals
- Often many signals *converged* on *monomeric GTPases* called *Rho Protein Family* --> [[How proteins work#Control with phosphorylation|molecular swtiches]] between active GTP-bound state and inactive GDP-bound state
