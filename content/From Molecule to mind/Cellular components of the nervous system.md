# History of what we know of nerve cells
- In the 19th century, the cell was first discovered
	- In 20th century, it was found that nervous tissue contained cells
		- It was difficult to see the complex nervous through old microscopes
- *Golgi* first made the *reticular theory* which proclaimed the brain is an interconnected network of cells
	- *Golgi* apparatus also named after him
	- Was kind-of vindicated when *gap junctions* were discovered, that do allow direct electrical signaling in for example lungs
- *Neural doctrine* (Cajal) replaced this by saying that discrete entities (nerve cells) communicate at specialized places
	-  Sherrington called these *synapses*
	- Due to *electron microscopy* (invented in 1950) this was proven 
# The nervous system
- Comprised of *[[neurons]]* and supporting *[[glial cells]]*
	- Most *[[Neurons]]* are specialized in signaling over long distances
		- *[[Glial cells]]* do other tasks in brain, like reparation of damage
		- - Neurons and glia share the complement of organelles found in all cells.
- Organelles shared by all cells including glia and neurons include endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and various vesicular structures.
	- In neurons and glia, these organelles are often more prominent in different regions of the cell.
		- Mitochondria tend to be concentrated at synapses in neurons.
		- Protein-synthetic organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum are largely excluded from axons and dendrites.
- Neurons and glia differ from other cells in the specialized fibrillary or tubular proteins that constitute the cytoskeleton or other important structures.
