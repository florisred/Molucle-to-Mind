## Secretory pathways
- *exocytosis*: the process of releasing (newly made) proteins out of the plasma membrane
## most proteins are covalently modified in the ER
- Most proteins that enter the *ER* are chemically modified there. 
	- *Disulfide bond*s are formed by the *oxidation of pairs of cysteine side chains*
	- Catalyzed by enzymes in the *ER*
	- *Cannot* happen in the *cytosol*, because the cytosol is *reducing* (think back to red-ox reactions in high school, I bet its buried somewhere deep there)
- *glycosylation*: the addition of sugar groups (*oligosaccharides*) to proteins in the *ER (lumen)* creates *glycoproteins*, serving multiple functions
	- *Protection*, to hold them in the ER during folding, or as a transport signal
	- This happens in *pre-made, branched oligosaccharide of 14 sugars* is attached to all proteins that have an attachment site --> done by *oligosaccharyl transferase* on the lumen side of the ER membrane -> [[example oligosaccharyl transferase]]
## exit from the er is controlled to ensure protein Quality
- *ER retention signal* keeps proteins destined to be in the ER in the ER, and returns them if they show up in the golgi apparatus -> 
	- most other proteins are destined somewhere else, budded in the ER and sent to Golgi
- Exit from the ER is *highly selective*
	- *chaparone proteins* hold proteins in the *ER* until they are properly folded
	- This automatically steers them in the right direction for protein folding
	- If it does not fold properly, it is degraded and discarded
		- This can also be bad! For example, in *cystic fibrosis*, or *taaislijmziekte*, a slightly misfolded protein that would still work is kept in the ER, causing bad lung damage
## The size of the er is controlled by the demand for protein
- Chaperones holding proteins in the ER can cause unfolded protein accumulation
	- When there are too many, *unfolded protein response (UPR)* kicks in, and causes more ER to be produced!
	- When the demand does not go away, *UPR* can even cause *apoptosis (programmed cell death)*
		- Can also be bad, like in *diabetes*, where due to high insulin demand, insulin secretion in the pancreas overwhelms the ER, causing apoptosis. This leads to even more insulin demand in the remaining cells, causing, you  know, diabetes. 
## proteins are Further modified and sorted in the golgi apparatus
- [[Golgi apparatus]] is usually situated close to the nucleus, often near *[[Microtubules#The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing center in animal cells|the centrosome]]*
	- Consists of *cisternae*, small sacs piled like stacks of [[Pita Bread]] each containing 3-20 cisternae
	- Has both a *cis-face* (its entry point), and a *trans-face*, where proteins exit
		- Cis is adjacent to the ER, trans is towards plasma membrane
	- after entering the *cis golgi*, proteins undergo more modifications (such as even more development of the olisaccharade), before exiting the *trans-golgi*, after which proteins are secreted or taken up by lysosomes
## secretory proteins are released from the cell by exocytosis
- *Exocytosis*: the fusing of transport vesicles with the plasma membrane
	- this is constantly happening: *constitutive exocytosis pathway*
	- *Secretion:* *constitutive exocytosis pathway* carries proteins to cell surface and releases them
- *Regulated exocytosis pathway*: in cells specialized for secretion
	- These accumulate near the end of the *trans Golgi*, awaiting signal to secrete
		- Allows vesicles to be packed way more densely
	- [[regulated vs constitutive exocytosis pathway]]
- When vesicles fuse with the membrane, it expands. So why doesn't the cell keep growing??
