# What are neural circuits?
- Neurons function when organized in *neural circuits*
- Synaptic connections made in a dense tangle of *dendrites*, *axon terminals*, and *glial cells*
	- this is called *neuropil*, most synaptic connectivity occurs here
## Directionality
- *Afferent neurons* carry information from periphery toward or deeper in the brain 
- *efferent neurons* carry information away from brain
## Example
- [[Myotatic reflex]] --> knee-jerk reflex
	- *afferent neurons* lie in *dorsal root ganglia* and project to skeletal muscles
	- *interneurons* lie in between
	- *efferent neurons*, motor neurons, bring it back to muscles
- Can be studied using *electrophysiological recording*
	- *extracellular recording*: electrode placed near nerve cell
		- For detecting temporal patterns
	- *Intracellular recording*: electrode placed inside the cell
		- For detecting smaller changes
- Can also be studied using *calcium imaging*
	- records the transient changes in intracellular concentration of calcium ions
## Optogenics
- Uses *opsins*, which can modulate membrane currents using light using ion channels
	- Can be used to modulate nerve cell activity
- Three have been identified: bacteriorhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and channelrhodopsin
	-  Both bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin have a net hyperpolarizing effect on cells
	- channelrhodopsin both depolarizes and hyper-polarizes depending on the variant and wavelengths of the light used
- Optogenics has a high temporal and spatial resolution at a variety of scales
