### All proteins bind to molecules
- Proteins can do their job because they bind to other molecules
	- *specificity*: proteins can only bind to a few of all molecules, very selective
		- Any substance that is bound by a protein is referred to as a *ligand* for that protein
		- for example, [[Other types of ion-channel gates#Ligand-Gated Ion Channels|ligand gated ion channel]]
	- This *specificity* arises because proteins bind with *non-covalent bonds*
		- These are **weak**, and thus require many to form a good bond. 
		- Due to the shape of the protein, only a specific type of molecule can form enough bonds to bind.
	- The *binding site*, where the proteins form their bonds, is often a **small cavity** in the surface
### Antibodies
- *Antibodies* are immunoglobulin proteins produced by the immune system in response to foreign molecules
	- They *recognize* and *target* the *antigens*
		- There are billions of antigens someone can encounter, so we must have billions of different antibodies to target those.
### Enzymes Are Powerful and Highly Specific Catalysts
- *Enzymes* are responsible for almost all chemical transformations in the body
- They bind to *substrates* to speed up or start reactions
- [[Common types of enzyme classes]]
- Many drugs inhibit enzymes
- Sometimes, enzymes bind small molecules that perform jobs that amino-acid chains just cannot do
	- Like *rhodopsin* or *hemoglobin* (although these are proteins lol)
#### Explaining enzymes using: The lysozyme
- *Lysozymes* are an enzyme that acts as a natural antibiotic in secretions & egg
	- severs the *polysaccharide chains* that form the cell walls of bacteria, killing it
	- Does this by adding a water molecule that breaks up the chain
- This reaction is *energetically favorable* (positive output energy), but has a high *activation energy*
	- Enzymes lower the *activation energy* to catalyze the reaction.
		- It does this by contorting the cell walls in such a way that water can bind easily
		- This is called the *transition state* 
- This reaction takes place in the *active site*
## Protein control
- Proteins must be controlled to maintain *homeostasis* in cells or larger bodies
### Enzymes controlled by other molecules
- Because there are thousands of enzymes in the cytoplasm at any given time, a complex web of *metabolic pathways* is formed. --> many controls are needed
- *Feedback inhibition*: a molecule further in a pathway inhibits an earlier reaction
	- a -> b - > c -> d (and d inhibits a -> b), making sure that not too much d can be produced
	- this is a *negative regulation* --> inhibits
	- *positive regulation* does the opposite
### Enzymes with two binding sites
- *Allosteric* proteins have two binding sites, one where the *substrate* binds and one where *regulatory molecules* bind
	- Regulatory molecules change the shape of the enzyme, enabling or disabling the binding site 
- Almost all proteins are *allosteric* --> two different and **stable** conformations that can be switched
### Control with phosphorylation
- Binding of a *phosphor group* is also very effective to control, as it has two negative charges
	- This can again contort or change the shape of the enzyme
	- This process is called *protein phosphorylation*, and is reversible
		- enzyme-catalyzed transfer of the terminal phosphate group of ATP to the *hydroxyl* group on a *serine*, *threonine*, or *tyrosine* side chain of the protein
		- Done by a *protein kinase*
	- This can be reversed by *protein phosphatase*
### Covalent control
- Aside from phosphorylation, over 100 different types of covalent bonds can affect proteins
	- Sometimes a protein can be modified at even more sites, sometimes even 20!
### GPT-binding proteins
- These proteins bind *GPT*, which can be converted into *GDP* (minus one phosphor group)
	- GTP: Active state, GDP: inactive state
		- GDP can be released and switched for another GTP molecule
- Again allows for switching on and off of protein
- They also allow proteins to navigate the *cytoskeleton of the cell*
	- In order to make sure that they move only one direction, a single step in the process is made irreversible 
		- Done by by coupling one of the conformational changes to the hydrolysis of an ATP molecule bound to the protein
		- This releases a lot of energy, and is thus not likely to happen in reverse
### Protein Machines
- Proteins Often Form Large Complexes That Function as *Protein Machines*
	- These protein machines do the most complex work (like DNA transcription)
	- Works bc the complex allows only a specific order of interactions, giving rise to complexity
