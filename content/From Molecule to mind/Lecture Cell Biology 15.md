# Essential cell biology chapter 15
## What is this chapter about?
- The cells & their content
	- Organelles of the cells & their function
- How proteins find their way into organelles, ni particular the mechanims they use to pass membranes
- Mechanisms of endo- and exocytosis

## Organelles
- The cell is packed full of organelles, there is not much more space 
- Everything is transported and kept in place by the cytoplasm
- They *seal off* different biochemical processes from interference
### Different organelles
- Endoplasmatic reticulum
	- Inside *ribosomes* transcribe to proteins
	- Mitochondria
	- Golgi Apparatus
	- lysosome 
		- Breakdown of protein
## Transport of organelles
- Is coded into the N-terminus of the proteins


# break
## How are proteins made
- ER signal sequence on growing polypeptide chai
- After a while of the protein being made in the ribosome, the signal part of the protein is cleaved off by signal peptidase
	- Signal sequence is hydrophobic, so it will stay in the membrane and be broken down
		- It does not serve a purpose anymore
	- and mature soluble protein in ER lumen
### Going from ER to Golgi apparatus
- Proteins are split off in small vesicles
	- If they are membrane proteins, they will be in membrane golgi
	- If they are internal proteins, they will be inside the golgi membrane
- *golgi apparatus* has many lamellae
	- In all these parts you have different types of enzymes that manipulate protein
	- A lot of neuronal proteins will have *sugar groups* on outside, can sometimes be recognized by other cells on the outside
		- These sugar groups are chemically put on protein in golgi apparatus
- Not  all proteins go through Golgi apparatus, namely the ones without signaling parts

### Endocytic vesicles are coated with proteins
- Vesicles are formed by adaptin forming on cargo molecules, which then again is coated with *clathrin* using *dunamin*
- Then it is uncoated (at the adaptin), and then you get a naked transport vesicle
	- This mechanism is abused by viruses
- Clathrin coats & adaptin also come in different variants
	- Important to know: Clathrin coat can have a say in the destination
### Exocytosis  of vesicles
- On the vesicles you have *vesicle snare proteins*
	- These keep the vesicles close to the target membrane
	- T-snare and V-snare form a complex, so closely that they have enough energy to *fuse the membranes*
		- In neuronal cells, these fusion processes can be controlled by *Calcium*
### Glycosilation of proteins in ER Lumen
- Adding a sugar group to the protein 
- If a protein is sitting in the membrane and it sits in the membrane of the ER and than later the golgi apparatus
	- If it goes into vesicles, the sugar group is inside of the vesicle membrane
	- When it fuses with the cell membrane, it turns inside out (because the inside the vesicle becomes outside of the cell) --> sugar groups come outside
### Chaperones 
- Found in ER
	- If things go wrong later (like in cytosol) they are destined for being broken down, *lysosome*
- Govern the folding of proteins (for example when folding went wrong)
	- Misfolded proteins are recognized by ER receptors 
		- They send a signal through the cytoplasm which switches on the chaperone gene
		- misfolded protein has a lot of hydrophobic residues on the outside (bc misfolded, should not normally be there) --> these are recognized by the ER receptors
	- Some cannot be refolded
		- This plays a big role in neurodisease
		- Misfolded proteins clump up and can die
### Lysozome
- has many molecules that end with -ase --> enzymes
- It needs to be prepared to destroy a lot
- has a pH of 5.0, whereas normal cytosol has 7.2
	- Proteins that work at 7.2 do not work at 5.0
	- Why? lysozome is a very dangerous organelle, as it breaks everything down 
	- but, in the cytoplasm the pH is too high for lysozomal function --> so the enzymes only work within the lumen of the lysozome
