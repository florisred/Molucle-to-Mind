### Basil Ganglia & movement
- We know this about 
- ![[Basal Ganglia]]
- The question was, weather this classical model of D1R (direct pathway) and D2R (indirect pathway) was correct:

![[Pasted image 20240919115115.png]]
- As you can see, when the direct pathway (the red line) is activated by the blue light, the striatal recording shows a lot of activity but the substantia nigra recording shows no activity --> inhibitory pathway
	- The APs seen are recorded outside of the cell, looks a bit different and is inverted

### Chemocenetics: DREADD technology
- Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs 
- you can put the genes for them in viruses
- We use *CNO* and the inhibitory receptors
- there are also receptors that will excite the cell
