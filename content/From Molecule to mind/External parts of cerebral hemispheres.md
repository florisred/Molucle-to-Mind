## Cerebrum
- Consists of *gyri* (outward fold) and *sucli* (inward fold)
- 
### Frontal lobe
- Occupies the *Anterior cranial fossa*
- Separated from temporal lobe by the *lateral sulcus*
- Separated from the *parietal lobe* by the *Superior central sulcus*
- On the underside: *olfactory tract* which ends at the *olfactory bulb*
### Temporal lobe
- Occupies *middle craniel fossa*
- Tip of the temporal lobe is called the *uncus*
- ventral to the lateral sulcus
### Occipital lobe
- Lies above the *tentorium*
### Parietal lobe
- located caudal to the central sulcus and dorsal to the lateral sulcus
### Insular cortex
- Beneath the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes
### Corpus callosum
- Connects the two cerebral hemispheres
