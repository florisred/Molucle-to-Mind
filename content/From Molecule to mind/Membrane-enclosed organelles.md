## Eukaryotic cells contain a set of membrane-enclosed organelles
- *Prokaryotic cells* only have one cell, with no cellular organelles
- *Eukaryotic cells* have membrane-enclosed organelles
	- This can help keep otherwise dangerous proteins separate from important structures
	- Organelles lie in the *cytosol*, which is in turn kept in the cell by the *plasma membrane*
	- *Nucleus* is the most prominent organelle
		- Surrounded by a double membrane, called the *nuclear envelope*
		- Communicates via the *nuclear pores*
		- Outer membrane is continuous with *endoplasmic reticulum*, (ER)
	- *ER* is a network of tubes and sacs that spans a large part of the cell
		- Most membrane is made there
		- *Ribosomes* are attached to the walls of the *rough endoplasmic reticulum*
			- *Synthesizing proteins* that are delivered into the *ER membrane* or into the *ER interior*  ---> *lumen*
		- *Smooth endoplasmic reticulum* -> no ribosomes
			- Steroid hormone synthesis & other specialized synthesis
	- *Golgi Apparatus*
		- Receives proteins and lipids from the *ER*
		- *lysosomes* break down degraded proteins
		- materials must first pass through *endosomes*
			- They sort the materials and sometimes recycle them
	- *Peroxisomes* break down lipids
	- *Mitochondria* / *chloroplasts (plants)* 
		- Surrounded by double membrane
		- Powerhouse of the cell

### How membrane enclosed organelles evolved
- Eukaryotic cells evolved out of prokaryotic cells
	- They had no organelles, could get by bc of their small size -> high membrane-plasma ratio
- The *ER, Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes, endosomes, and lysosomes* are all part of what is collectively called the *endomembrane* system
	- Evolved out of the cells own plasma membrane
	- interiors of these organelles are treated by the cell in many ways as *extracellular*
- *Mitochondria and chloroplasts* have their own small genome
	- Probably started as a bacterium engulfing other cells, living in symbiosis
