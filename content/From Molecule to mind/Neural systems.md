# What are neural systems?
- Basically just subsets of neural circuits that serve one clear purpose (like the visual system)
- Can be distributed over the whole body
- Often uses *parallel pathways*
- For sensory processing *topographic maps* are common
	- reflect a point-to-point correspondence between the sensory periphery and neighboring neurons within the central components of the system
	- Motor systems also use this
# Genetic analysis of neural systems
## GWAS
- Often genetic analysis is done by studying families with an heritable trait
- Sometimes looking at statistics from large populations abt genetics and diseases
	- *Genome-wide association studies* (GWAS)
	- after a gene has been shown to correlate with disease, we can use animals with *orthologous genes* (similar or identical ones) to study further.
- Most analysis has been done on mice, but sometimes also on fruit flies or worms
	- through *mutagenesis*
## [[Genetic engineering]]
- alternative to mutagenesis
- Often done in mice
- mutations that parallel those found in humans can be made in orthologous mouse genes
- uses *homologous recombination* 
	- DNA polymerase and ligase can mistake synthetic DNA for real DNA at specific locations
	- This is done to an embryo, after which the adult mouse can pass it on to offspring
## Conditional mutations, Cre/Lox system
- bacterial loxP sequences are introduced to a gene, in addition to *Cre Recombinase*
	- Knock-in and knock-out mice can be engineered for conditional mutations using the Cre/lox system.
	- The Cre/lox system involves an exogenous recombinase (Cre) that recognizes unique DNA excision sequences (loxP sequences) introduced at the 5′ and 3′ ends of an endogenous gene.
	- The loxP sequences are not found in mammalian genomes but occur in genomes of bacteria targeted by certain viruses.
	- The viruses use a unique DNA cutting enzyme, called Cre recombinase (Cre stands for Causes recombination), to cut pieces of DNA out of the bacterial genome and then recombine the cut ends.
	- Cre recombinase is not found in any vertebrate genome, so in applying the Cre/lox system to murine models, the gene encoding Cre recombinase must first be introduced into the mouse genome.
	- The Cre insert is engineered so that it has DNA sequences on the 5′ and 3′ ends that are homologous to an endogenous mouse gene.
	- During mitotic DNA replication, the Cre DNA gets recombined into the genome at that locus and is then expressed under the control of the promoter and other regulatory sequences for that gene.
	- With expression of the Cre DNA, the resulting Cre recombinase engages the loxP binding sites, and the intervening endogenous exon targeted for elimination (the so-called floxed sequence) is excised.
# Structural analysis of neural systems
- *Lesion studies* look at what problems occur after specific neurological damage and make assumptions based on that -> language areas in the brain
- *anterograde* studies from source to termination, *retrograde* from termination to source
	- originally done with single cell tracers
	- Now done by inserting tracer proteins into nucleus of a target neuronal population
	- acts as a virus which slowly lights up the entire network
- *antibody tracers* allow very specific illumination within a cell
# Functional analysis of neural systems
## Electrophysiological recording
- Use microelectrode to record action potentials (often single cell, sometimes more)
- can give insight into what a neuron is *tuned* to --> what it responds most to
	- Defines *receptive field* of a neuron
		- the response to different odorant molecules can be used to define the preferences of individual neurons in the olfactory system
- Also often uses [[Brain Imaging techniques]]
## Cognitive neuroscience
- While we can often (kind of) understand and break down simpler processes in the brain, analyzing complex things such as consciousness, memory, or emotions is more difficult
- This is what *cognitive neuroscience is for*
- Often done by studying *neuroethology*, which analyzes animal behavior in natural habitat
	- Helps making *tasks* for during a scientific study
