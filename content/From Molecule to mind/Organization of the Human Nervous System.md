# Broad organization
## Three different types of neural systems
1. Sensory systems
	- like the name suggests, gathers information from the outside world
2. Motor systems
	- makes humans capable of affecting the world around them
3. Associational systems
	- any level of higher level thinking
## Components of the nervous system
- *Central Nervous system*, CNS, comprises the brain and the spinal chord
- *Peripheral nervous system*, PNS, comprises everything else
	- Sensory neurons
	- Motor neurons
		- somatic motor division --> skeletal muscles
		- visceral / autonomic motor division -> we can control ourselves
	- Cell bodies are located in *ganglia*
		- Local accumulations of nerve bodies & supporting cells
## Gray and White matter
- *Gray matter* is any accumulation of cell bodies and *neuropil*
	- Small local accumulations with similar functions are called *nucleus*
	- *Cortex* describes sheetlike arrays of nerve cells
- *White matter* are axon tracts and *commissures*
	- Commissures are tracts that cover the midline of the brain (corpus callosum)
## Sympathetic and Parasympathetic 
### Sympathetic division of autonomic motor system
- ganglia lie along or in front of the vertebral column and send their axons to a variety of targets
### Parasympathetic divison
- ganglia are found in or adjacent to the organs they innervate
## Enteric system
- Small ganglia and neurons throughout the wall of the gut
