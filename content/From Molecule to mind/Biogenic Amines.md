## Biogenic Amines
- Regulate many brain functions in both CNS and PNS
- The big five:
	- *catecholamines*(*dopamine*, *norepinephrine/noradrenaline*), *epinephrine/adrenaline*,  *histamine* and *serotonin*
- Catecholamines all share Catechol moiety and common precursor:
	- Tyrosine
### Dopamine
- Present in multiple brain regions
	- Mostly substantia negra though, maybe corpus striatum
	- In Parkinsons, this is broken
- *DAT*: dopamine co-transporter that helps reuptake
	- Cocaine blocks this, leading to more dopamine
	- Amphetamine does this too
- Major enzymes for Dopamine metabolism are
	- MAO (monoamine oxidase)
	- Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT)
- Dopamine only works with [[G-protein]] coupled receptors
- Transported in *VMAT*
### Norepinephrine
- Locus Coeruleus (brainstem nucleus projecting to forebrain)
- Influences sleep, wakefulness, arousal, attention, and feeding behavior
- Neurons in ganglion cells are the most prominent users
- Norepinephrine synthesis requires dopamine Î²-hyroxylase, which catalyzes the production of norepinephrine from dopamine 
- also transported in VMAT
- Cleared from synaptic cleft by NET (norepinephrine transporter)
- Also degraded by MAO and COMT
- Acts on G-protein coupled receptors again
	- have alpha receptors -> work on K<sup>+</sup> channels
	- And beta receptors 
		- antagonists called *beta-blockers* -> for treating heart shit
### Epinephrine
- Adrenaline
- Less common in the brain
- Most prevalent in respiration and cardiac function
- also uses VMAT
### Histamine
- Found in hypothalamic neurons
	- But project almost everywhere
- all have metabotropic receptors
- Some cross the blood-brain barrier
	- These have a sedative function
### Serotonin
- Found in neurons of Pons and Upper brainstem
- Regulate sleep and wakefulness
- Taken advantage of by many drugs --> SSRI's, for example
- Synthesized by tryptophan
- Also uses VMAT
- Uses SERT for transportation -> again, used in SSRI's
- Receptors again are metabotropic receptors
- Linked to: circadian rhythms, motor behaviors, emotional states, and state of mental arousal
- When not working correctly can cause depression, schizophrenia, etc.
- LSD works by virtue of seratonin
