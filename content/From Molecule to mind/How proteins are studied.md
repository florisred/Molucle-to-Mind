## Now vs then
- It used to be very difficult to get a lot of a single protein
- Now, it is easier because we can design specific cells in a lab to synthesize a lot of a single protein using genetic manipulation
## Proteins purified from cells or tissues
- After an amount of cells or tissues have synthesized the protein, we break open all the cells
	- we are then left with *cell homogenate* or *extract*.
- After that, *chromatography* is applied to isolate the protein
	- Can be sped up with *affinity chromatography*, where (for example) antibodies recognizing the protein are attached to the *matrix of a chromatography column* to speed up isolation
- *electrophoresis* can also be used instead.
	- mixture of proteins is placed in a polymer gel and subjected to an electric field
		- Proteins will migrate through the gel at different speeds, so it forms blobs that all only contain a single protein
## Determining the protein structure
### Begins with the amino-acid sequence
- Is nowadays done with *mass spectrometry*
	- Can see the exact mass of every peptide fragment in a purified protein, which can be matched to a protein in the genetic code of the cell
- Is expanded upon with a second mass spectrometry session after breaking the proteins down, called *tandem mass spectrometry*
- Although all the folding info is in the genetic code, we cannot deduce it yet so we need another technique to see what the structure of the protein will be
	- X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
	-
