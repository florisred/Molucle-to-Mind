# Course Introduction
## Goals
- Remembering brain areas & functions
- Understanding how connections are formed between neuroanatomical systems
- Apply knowledge during practical lessons
- Formulating diagnoses
- Think critically
- Have a 3D mental image of brai
## What to learn for the exam?
- Purves book
- Practical guides 1-5
- Not an official part: the slides / lectures
## How ics exam grade calculated?
- 1/3 = Cell- and molecular neurobiology
- 1/3 = neurophysiology
- 1/3 =  neuroanatomy
	- All three given by big names in AMS neuroscience
## Assignments
- Explain your subject form an anatomical * functional perspective
- see Purves, short movies and practical guides
- Make it fun
- Around 20 min per group
	- Plus some time for discussion and questions
- Use the feedback form to prepare (on canvas)
- Include exam questions
- Entire group either passes or fails
	- Pass = 30% of neuroanatomy grade done
## Lectures
- Always start at 10.00 (except sep 9th)
- Two consequtive hours
	- First group presents (20min)
	- first group receies feedback
	- other groups prepare.
## Practical sessions
- Most fun part of the anatomy course
- four Thursdays
	- 19, 26 september, 3 10 Oktober.
	- Prepare well!!
# Functional Neuroanatomy
## The basics
It starts with the neural tube.
[[Neural tube expansions]]
1. Cephalic flexure
2. Cervical flexure
3. pontine flexure
- These fold into each other, forming different parts of the brain
- [[Anatomical Directions & Sectioning]] -> very important to remember
## The brain's major white matter tracts
### [[Myelin]]
- Dorien Maas has studied myelin her entire career
- Surrounds axons and are produced by Oligendedrocyte 
	- Arise from OPCs --> Oligodendrocyte precursor cells
	- Are even there in adult brain --> this is rare
	- If you have a brain injury, this can repair it --> plasticity
		- Not always good: Can become cancerous (Glioma)
#### Glioma
- Heterogenous brain tumors with glial characteristics
	- Heterogenous means that there are different outcomes within the same type of disease
- often accompanied by cognitive impairment
- treated by surgical removal of the tumor, chemo and radiation therapy
- OPCs in glioma
	• Cell of origin
	• Essential for cognitive functioning which is impaired in glioma
	• Neuron-glioma synapses are similar to neuron-OPC synapses
- White matter abnormalities in Glioma
	- Lower white matter fiber density and lower integrity of white matter tracts throughout the brain in glioma patients.
	- This correlates with cognitive impairment.
		- Cognitive impairment in glioma is likely caused bywhite matter abnormalities.
		- [[Research dorine maas]] is what Dorine is now doing research on. 
- Essential things to understand relation white matter and glioma
	- Glioma arise in white matter
	- Glioma preferentially occur in white matter tracts that mature later in life
	- Glioma recur in the white matter
	- Glioma cells migrate through white matter
	- Glioma gives white-matter related symptoms; cognitive impairment and complex symptomatology related to its exact location

## White matter structures in the brain
### Major fiber systems in the telencephalon
- Association fibers -> connect cortical regions of the same hemisphere
	- Arcuate fasciculus
		- Inferior to main nerve
		- connects language areas
	- Inferior/superior longitudinal fasciculus
	- Occipitofrontal fasciculus Cingulum
- Commisural fibers --> connect two hemispheres
	- Corpus Callosum
- Projection fibres --> Project to spinal chord
	- Internal capsule
- Most inhibitory neurons only project locally, excitatory can project from mone hemisphere to another --> but then have an inhibitory effect on the other side of the brain
### Uncinate fasciculus
- Location: Connects the frontal lobe (specifically, theanterior parts including the orbitofrontal cortex) to the temporal lobe (especially the anterior temporal cortex)
- Function:
	- Significant role in emotional regulation, social cognition, and memory
	- indeed, cognitive symptoms are common in insular glioma!
### Inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus
- Location
	- connect frontal / occipital lobe
- Function
	- Visual processing & integrating it
	- Indeed, you see visual problems in insular glioma
### Arcuate fasciculus
- Location
	- Conncect frontal lobes / parietal lobe in dominant hemisphere
- Function
	- Plays a crucial role in language processing, particularly in language production, comprehension, and repetition
### Inferior longitudinal fasciculus
- Location
	- Runs along bottom of brain, connects occipital & temporal
- Function
	- Visual processing and recognition of complex visual stimuli, including faces and objects
### Corpus Callosum
- Connects the two cerebral hemispheres of the brain
- Function Facilitates communication and information exchange between the left and right hemispheres
### Cingulate fasciculus
- involved in frontal glioma
- Location 
	- Encircles the cingulate cortex and runs along the inner surface of the brain’s hemispheres
- Function
	- Involved in various functions, including emotion regulation, memory, and attention
### Corona radiata and internal capsule
- Location
	- Runs between basal ganglia and thalamus to cerebral cortex
- Functions
	- Communication between different regions of the brain, transmission of sensory and motor information, as well as higher-order cognitive and sensory-motor integration signals.

# Neuroanatomy Presentation
##  Skull, meninges, vasculature
### Learning Goals
•Embedding of the brain and spinal cord in the head and body
•Blood supply
•Liquor: production, drainage, function
### Skull
 - Look at openings in the skull 
### Meninges
- Maybe talk about herniation --> meninges detached from brain
	- Epidural hematoma
