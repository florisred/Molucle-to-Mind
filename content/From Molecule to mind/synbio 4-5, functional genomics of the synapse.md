## Functional genomics: Presynaptic vesicle cycle
- This is an example, you do not really need to know all the specifics i believe
- Start with the proteins in Purves
	- Synaptotagmin
	- Synaptobrevin
- In a fly a post-synaptic cell is recorded, and after nerve stimulation Sodium influx changes the current
	- Just like when after postsynaptic receptors activate the sodium channels
- A fly with the Synb-1 or Syx-1 can still have docking vesicles, but do not convey a signal
	- *Glutamate iontophoresis*: dropping a bit of gutamate to check if the postsynaptic receptors do still work -> yeah they do
## In mice
- Synchronous synaptic transmission is impaired in Syt1 null mutant neurons![[Pasted image 20241007160841.png]]
- After synaptotagmin has been removed, a single neuron is taken on a astrocyt island where it forms synapses with itself
	- Compared with controls, these mice have an asynchronous response
	- Therefore, synaptotagmin is probably related to synchronous synapse response
	- So vesicles can still fuse, but not synchronized
- If you then 'rescue' these cells by inserting synaptotagmin gene on a virus
	- not all synaptotagmin proteins, but some. ![[Pasted image 20241007161434.png]]
## Part 2
- upstream processes -> [[Drawing Transposon]] forward genetics
- Mustard gas (aldicarb) disables ACh reuptake -> you die a horrible death
- But, worms can live without a nervous system, so when you do forward genetics you can find worms that do not secrete acetylcholine. --> they will survive, but called *Unc* -> uncoordinated
- But the whole brain develops in the absence of synaptic transmission
- Munc-18 is important for docking of synaptic vesicles. You can 
### Munc-13 overexpression
- This means that many more vesicles are *released*
-
