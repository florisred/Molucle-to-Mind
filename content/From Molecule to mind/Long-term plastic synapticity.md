## Long-term synaptic plasticity
- [[Short-term plastic synapticity]] cannot account for the long and bigger changes in the brain
- But, these can be hard to study -> we use model organisms
## Marine mollusk *Aplysia californica*
- Has about 10,000 neurons
- Taught us about many processes contributing to long term plasticity:
### Habituation
- Animal less responsive to sequential triggering of the same stimulus
	- We initially feel our clothes after putting them on, but forget about them soon
### Sensitization --> [[example of sensitization]]
- *Sensitization* is a process that allows an animal to generalize an aversive response—elicited by a noxious stimulus—to a variety of other, non-noxious stimuli
	- In Aplysia, if you touch the *mantle*, its gill will withdraw
	- If you do this a lot, it will *habituate*, and if you then apply a painful stimulus such as an electric shock, the gill-withdraw reflex will become more sensitive and longer
### Short-term sensitization of the gill-withdraw response
- Sensitization modifies the function of this circuit by recruiting additional neurons
	- Tail shock evokes *sensory neurons*, which affect *modulatory interneurons*
	- These release *serotonin* in the presynaptic terminals of neurons to do with the gill response
		- This leads to increased motor neuron activation
	- Serotonin binds to *G-protein-coupled receptors* stimulating *cAMP* production
	- This binds to *PKA* -> second messenger [[Second messengers#Protein kinases|PKA]]
		- This then *phosphorylates* many proteins, probably including the K<sup>+</sup> channel
			- This causes the K<sup>+</sup> channel to stay open longer, causing more Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter the cell
			- This probably causes the cells to become more senstive!
- This way, the sensitization holds for about 30 minutes to an hour
	- We do not know the exact mechanisms yet though -> above is an estimation 
### Long-term sensitization of the gill-withdraw response
- A similar mechanism is probably behind the long-term sensitization
	- But then it probably works through *gene expression* -> [[Overview of gene expression]]
	- The *PKA* probably activates [[Nuclear signaling#CREB - The cAMP response element binding protein|CREB - The cAMP response element binding protein]]
		- Releases *ubiquitin* -> degrades the PKA eventually causing it to become permanently activated
		- Basically, through a long cascade of signals that we *have not yet understood*, gene expression is changed leading to long-lasting synaptic changes
		- *CPEB* is also involved
	- Im not summarizing the entire pathway bc the book literally says we dont exactly know, so I do not expect any specific questions on it
		- I think the most important part is that it changes *gene expression*
