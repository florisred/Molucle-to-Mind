## What does it look like?

## Chromatid vs chromatin
- Heterochromatin is all of the genomic data
	- Chromatid is just one of the two chromosome copies

## Gene expression
- all of this happens in neurons, and the amount of packing determines how hard it is to read
	- If you have a free DNA, this is accessible to be read
- Can be turned off or on using this by *Phosphorylation*, or *methylation* for example
- A lot of problems with this regulation (done by H3 Histone modifiers) can give rise to neurodevelopmental disorders
