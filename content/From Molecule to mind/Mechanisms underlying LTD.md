## Why LTD?
- If you only encode info with LTP, eventually all synapses would reach a maximum activation
	- This would make it impossible to store information, as everything just gets activated all the time
- Therefore, *Long Term Depression* must happen as well 
	- -> no worries though, studying for this exam causes enough long term depression in all of us
## How LTD?
- LTD occurs when the Schaffer collaterals are stimulated at a low rate—about 1 Hz—for long periods (10–15 minutes).
-  LTD can erase the increase in EPSP size due to LTP, and conversely, LTP can erase the decrease in EPSP size due to LTD -> they compliment each other
- LTP and *LTD* share many of the same elements: Just some basic facts:
	- **LTP and LTD Mechanism:** Both LTP and LTD require NMDA receptor activation and Ca2+ entry, but the magnitude and speed of the Ca2+ signal determine whether LTP or LTD occurs.
	- **LTP and LTD Protein Regulation:** LTP is associated with protein kinase activation and phosphorylation, while LTD is linked to phosphatase activation and dephosphorylation.
	- **LTP and LTD Receptor Changes:** LTP is associated with AMPA receptor insertion, while LTD is often associated with AMPA receptor loss due to internalization
		- This means that vesicles that normally remove membrane also remove AMPA receptors from the membrane [[Neurotransmitters & their release#Endocytosis and Vesicle Recycling|vesicle recycling]]
## LTD in Purkinje cells
- *Purkinje* cells in the *cerebellum* receive two types of *excitatory input*
	- climbing fibers and parallel fibers
	- LTD *decreases* transmission in both of these
		- This has been found to correspond to *motor learning* -> that is what the cerebellum does
- First, both *climbing fibres* and *parallel fibres* need to activate simultaneously
	- Climbing fibers lead to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, parallel to Glutamate release
		- Glutamate is received by *AMPA* and *metabotropic glutamate receptors* (*mGluRs*) on Purkinje cells
		- AMPA cells create depolarization, mGluRs generate second messengers, *inositol triphosphate* (IP₃) and *diacylglycerol* (DAG)
		- IP₃ triggers the release of *Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores*.
		- Ca²⁺, along with *DAG*, synergistically activates protein kinase C (*PKC*).
		- Here, the *PKC* act as the *coincidence detector* -> both DAG and ca<sup>2+</sup> required
		- *PKC* then *phosphorylates* downstream substrate proteins, including AMPA receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.
			- Again, this causes AMPA receptors to be removed with [[Neurotransmitters & their release#Endocytosis and Vesicle Recycling|vesicle recycling]], causing LTD
- [[Nuclear signaling#CREB - The cAMP response element binding protein|CREB]] again seems to be important here
