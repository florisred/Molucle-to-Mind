# Imaging the human brain
## X-Rays
- Early
- [[pneumoencephalography and cerebral angiography]]
	- uses air or another contrast agent to make it viable
	- This gives discomfort and risk, so its now not popular anymore
## EEG and cortical surface stimulation
-  Electroencephalography *EEG* uses non-penetrating surface electrodes to detect changes in electrical activity 
	- *ERP* (event related potential) can be used to see what pattern of electrical output is seen at a specific task
- You can also stimulate the brain like this, to see what the effect is on behavior## TMS
- *Transcranial magnetic stimulation* gives electrical pulses to specific areas to block them and see what the result is
- this is a newer method
## Computerized Tomography; *CT*
### Basics
- from 1970s
- Non-invasive
- Uses *small X-Ray beam* and a rotating detector to detect small changes
	- forms 3D image of the brain
- Still exposes patient to X-Rays, so not very good.
### What does CT make visible?
- Distinguishes [[Organization of the Human Nervous System#Gray and White matter|Gray and white matter]]
- Ventricles
- Other structures and laesions that X-Rays were not good enough for
- few millimeter accuracy
## Magnetic Resonance Imaging, *MRI*
### MRI
- From 1980s
- Works based on atomic motion
	- Strong magnets align atoms in the same direction
	- A brief radiofrequency pulse is applied to atoms, tuned to the atomsâ€™ spinning frequency.
	- The atoms are knocked out of alignment with the field, emitting energy in an oscillatory fashion as they re-align themselves with the field.
	- The strength of the emitted signal depends on the number of atomic nuclei affected by the process.
	- This can be read and constructed to a 3D-image
- Safer, non-invasive, versatility, and better resolution than *CT* make it a really good option
- Can also detect changes in metabolic intermediates that may be related to ongoing neurotransmission --> neurotransmittter activity can be mapped
	- Often done with *N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)*
		- indicator of glutamatergic transmission in the brain
### DTI 
- Looks at alignment of water molecules to visualize axon pathways
- and to look at vasculature
# Functional human imaging
- Often detects blood flow or metabolites quickly so we can see which brain regions are most active
- Blood flow:
	- positron emission tomography (*PET*), single-photon emission computerized tomography (*SPECT*), functional magnetic resonance imaging (*fMRI*), and magnetoencephalography (*MEG*)

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Imaging Technique**|**Isotope/Compound**|**Detection**|**Resolution**|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|PET Scanning|Unstable positron-emitting isotopes (e.g., 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose)|Gamma ray detectors|4 mm|Visualizes activity-dependent changes in blood flow, tissue metabolism, or biochemical activity|Requires radioactive isotopes, expensive, limited spatial resolution|
|SPECT|Radiolabeled compounds (e.g., 133Xe, 123I-labeled iodoamphetamine)|Gamma camera|Lower than PET|Less expensive than PET, can be used for real-time imaging|Lower spatial resolution than PET, less sensitive|
|fMRI|Hemoglobin in blood|Magnetic resonance imaging|1-2 mm|Least invasive, most cost-effective, high spatial resolution|Requires strong magnetic field, can be uncomfortable for some subjects|
