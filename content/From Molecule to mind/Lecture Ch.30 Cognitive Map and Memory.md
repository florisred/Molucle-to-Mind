## Cognitive maps in the hippocampal formation
- *Declarative* vs *Non-declarative* memories
	- Declarative is like stories / episodes 
		- *[[Hippocampus]]* is very important in associating context in episodes
		- Sequence of events is remembered step-by-step association
	- *Hippocampus* is very important in recognizing *where we are* in space
		- Hippocampus has *place cells* -> they start to fire when an animal is in a specific place
		-  *Entorhinal cortex* has these too, but has many that all correspond to a place in on the ground --> called *grid cells*
			- Divide the space into a *hexagonal grid*
				- The deeper you go in the *ER* (further towards dorsal->ventral axis), the more spaced out this will be
		- ![[Pasted image 20241004164645.png|300]]
	- This makes these structrures a *cognitive map* -> encodes self-location of the mice!
	- If you could measure all the *place cells*, you could know exactly where the mouse is
- Does the hippocampus then contain a map of every place the mouse has ever visited?
	- *no* -> the map has to be built up over time -> *becomes more stable in a few days*
		- Requires NMDA receptors to be active! [[Lecture Ch.8 Memory#Memory & molecular mechanisms|NMDA receptors]]
- Other types of cells in the *ER*:
	- *Border cells* -> only fire when in the edge of a grid cell place thingy
	- *Head direction cells* -> fire at a specific direction the head is pointing
- Other types of cells in the *hippocampal formation*
	- Some other cells also fire when another animal is in a particular direction / place
	- Reward cells will fire when the animal moves towards a rewared
	- Boundary cells
	- Goal directions cells
## Does the cognitive map go beyond space?
- Since context-related memories are processed by the hippocampus, does the cognitive map also extend to other modalities?
- This was tested in the paper with *sound
	- Sound consists of waves of compressed air that enter our eardrum
	- If they oscillate fast enough, we can hear it as frequencies
	- The *cognitive environment* is going to be a *frequency spectrum*
		- Can the hippocampus encode *where in the frequency-space* where the animal is
	- They put mice in a box with a lever, when they pulled it a sound started playing. When the sound got in a certain *frequency space* they need to release it![[Pasted image 20241004171724.png|400]]
- They determined that frequency is the influencing factor, not time, by shifting the amount of time it takes to reach the *target zone*  ->> but is this done by hippocampus?
	- They found three types of cells in the *HF* that respond:
		1. Cells that fire only when first pulling down the lever
		2. Cells that fire only when releasing the lever
		3. Cells that ramp up in activity while the lever is pulled down
			- It becomes stronger until it releases the lever, then it stops
	- 40% of CA1 and 51% of MEC cells were significantly modulated during this task
	- There is a complete representation of the task when looking at all the cells
	- ![[Pasted image 20241004173215.png|300]]
- So is this necessary for the task, or do they just respond to sound frequencies?
	- only 1.7 % of CA1 cells respond to sound alone! 
		- If we then make it predictive of a reward, 20.2% of cells were active, but *range of field* was much larger than during the first task
- Are these *sound-space* cells also cells that are active during *spatial mapping?*
	- 25.1% of hippocampus CA1 cells show activity in both conditions
	- So there is *overlap*, but not 100%. Some cells take place in either or in none of these cognitive domains
	- Same thing in the *entorhinal cortex*
		- 34.3% of grid cells modulated by both sound and space
		- Border & head direction cells are *also* modulated by the task!
- Wider fields in grids correspond to wider fields during the task!
	- When they enocde an environment there are cells that always cover a broader and cells that only cover a narrower part of the environment
