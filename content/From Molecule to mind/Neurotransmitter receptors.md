## Neurotransmitter receptors
- Two main types of receptors: [[Ligand-gated ion channels vs G-protein]]
- Mainly differ in activation time (from 1ms to minutes) -> g-protein is slower
- Many neurotransmitters activate both!
### ionotropic receptors / Ligand-gated ion channels
- These contain a membrane-spanning domain that forms an ion channel 
- Combine transmitter-binding and channel functions in one!
### metabotropic receptors / G-protein coupled receptors
- Do not have ion channels in them --> rely on intervening metabolic steps
	- Use *G-Proteins* as intermediary steps --> [[Receptors#G-Protein|G-protein]]
	- These are normally situated on the receptor, but when the receptor is triggered the G-protein decouples
		- Then goes on to bind to / interact with ion channel directly
## Postsynaptic Membrane Permeability Changes during Synaptic Transmission
- *ACh* binds to receptors in the postsynaptic membrane of a muscle fiber, opening ligand-gated ion channels.
	  - Can be measured using the *patch-clamp* method.
	  - Similar to how voltage-gated channels respond to membrane potential changes.
- During an *action potential*, millions of *ACh molecules* are released from the *presynaptic motor neuron*.
	  - They bind to thousands of receptors, synchronously opening ion channels.
	  - Each receptor generates a *microscopic current*.
	  - When many receptors are activated, this creates a *macroscopic current* called the *End Plate Current (EPC)*, leading to depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.
	  - The depolarization causes the *End Plate Potential (EPP)*, which can trigger an action potential by opening *voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels*.
### Reversal Potential and Ion Permeability
- *Reversal potential (Erev)*: the membrane potential where no net current flows.
  - At the neuromuscular junction, this is around *0 mV*.
	- The relationship between EPC and membrane potential (*Vm*) is:
	  - **EPC = gACh (Vm - Erev)**
	  - *gACh*: conductance of ACh-activated channels.
	  - *Vm*: membrane potential.
	  - *Erev*: reversal potential.
- The EPC is:
	  - Inward at potentials more negative than *Erev*.
	  - Outward at potentials more positive than *Erev*.
- The *magnitude* and *direction* of the EPC depend on the *electrochemical driving force (Vm - Erev)*, while *gACh* depends on how many ACh-bound receptors there are.
### Ion Selectivity
- *ACh-activated channels* are not selective for a single ion:
	  - If permeable only to *K+*, Erev would be near *-100 mV*.
	  - If permeable only to *Na+*, Erev would be near *+70 mV*.
	  - If permeable only to *Cl-*, Erev would be near *-50 mV*.
		- Since Erev is around *0 mV*, the channels are permeable to both *Na+* and *K+*.
### Ion fluxes & postsynaptic potential changes
- The polarity and magnitude of the *EPC* on the permeant ions,
	-  in turn determines the polarity and magnitude of the *EPP*
	-  EPPs will depolarize when the membrane potential is more negative than Erev , and *hyperpolarize* when the membrane potential is more positive than Erev
- The general rule, then, is that the action of a *transmitter* drives the postsynaptic membrane potential toward *Erev* for the particular ion channels being activated
- This creates an electrical current --> *Post Synaptic Current* (PSC)
	- This produces a *post-synaptic potential* (PSP)
