## Cell differentiation and cellular memory
- Cell differentiation allows cells to specify highly into regular tissues
	- Once a cell is differentiated, the cell will remain that way after undergoing division
	- Therefor, the cell must some type of *cellular memory*
## Eukaryotic genes Are controlled by combinations of transcription regulators
- *transcription regulators* can affect genes many nucleotides away
	- Not irregular to see regulators spread out over thousands of nucleotides, but not all parts are important --> some are *spacers*
- We have seen so far very simple mechanisms, but in reality it is often much more complicated
- *combinatorial control*: groups of transcription regulators work together to determine the expression of a single gene --> [[example Lac operon]]
	- In eukaryotes, much more complex -> often dozens regulators instead of two in a *comittee of regulators*
- [[example complexity of eukaryotic transcription regulators]]
- Despite this complexity, the expression of different genes can Be coordinated by a single protein
	- One protein can act as the final *keypress* of a 4-digit code on many genes, unlocking them all if all the other digits have already been typed in (or transcription factors bound)
### Combinatorial control for cell differentiation
- We also found that genes encoding cell-specific proteins are switched on as it differentiates
	- Done by a small number of key regulators
- You can even convert cells from one to the other using this
- These key regulators (regulatory proteins) can be combined to form specific cells
	- [[example combinatorial control]]
### specialized cells can be reprogrammed to pluripotent cells
- This process is called *de-differentiation*
- They can then be used to treat many diseases or do research
### The formation of an entire organ can Be triggered by a single transcription regulator
- From studies of eye development in Drosophila [[Lecture Drosophila, 20-09-2024]]
	- The Ey regulator triggers the development of the eye --> can be triggered to grow on the leg
- The Ey regulator functions as any other would
	- But it also functions as a cascade of other regulators, explaining how organ be growin
### Epigenetic mechanisms in differentiated cells
- _Epigenetic mechanisms_ allow differentiated cells to maintain their identity
    - Differentiated cells generally remain the same after division, and their progeny cells will retain that identity
        - Some cells like neurons or skeletal muscle cells do not divide again (terminally differentiated)
        - Other differentiated cells (e.g., fibroblasts, smooth muscle, liver cells) divide but maintain their specialized identity
- _Cell memory_ ensures that patterns of gene expression responsible for cell identity are passed to daughter cells
    - One way to achieve this is via a _positive feedback loop_
        - A master _transcription regulator_ activates its own gene and other cell-specific genes, ensuring that daughter cells continue to express the same identity
        - Example: the _Ey protein_ maintains a positive feedback loop
        - This mechanism creates a self-sustaining circuit of gene expression
#### Other epigenetic mechanisms
- _DNA methylation_ is another way to reinforce cell identity
    - Methylation occurs on cytosine bases and generally silences genes
    - Methylation patterns are passed to daughter cells by copying the methylation from the parent strand to the daughter strand
- _Histone modification_ also maintains gene expression patterns
    - When DNA is replicated, daughter cells receive half of the parentâ€™s histones (with covalent modifications)
    - Enzymes replicate these histone modifications, maintaining the chromatin structure of the parent chromosome
#### Epigenetic inheritance
- These mechanisms of gene expression transmission are _epigenetic_ because they do not alter the DNA sequence
    - Epigenetic changes help cells record environmental signals permanently
        - This has implications for cell functioning and diseases
