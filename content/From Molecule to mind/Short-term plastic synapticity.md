# Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity
- Due to changes that *strengthen* or *weaken* the synaptic transmission
- [[Overview all short-term synaptic plasticity]]
## Synaptic facilitation 
- *Synaptic facilitation*: Rapid increase in strength when 2 or more [[Action potentials]] arrive at the presynaptic terminal within a few milliseconds of each other
	- Lasts for tens of milliseconds
	- Due to *prolonged elevation of presynaptic calcium levels* as removing of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from presynaptic terminal is slower -> normally targeting *synaptotagmin 7*
## Synaptic depression
- Causes *neurotransmitter* release to *decline* during sustained activity
	- Caused by *depletion* of the synaptic vesicles containing *neurotransmitters*
	- Therefore, the time it takes to decline is related to how fast it is transmitted
## Synaptic potentiation & augmentation
- Both arise from more sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup> but are not well understood
- *Augmentation* is over a few seconds
- *Potentiation* is over a few minutes, also called **post-tetanic potentiation (PTP)**
## How this can all interact:
- The peripheral neuromuscular synapse experiences repeated activity that causes an accumulation of Ca2+ in the presynaptic terminal.
- This accumulation allows for facilitation and augmentation, which enhance synaptic transmission.
- The depletion of synaptic vesicles then causes depression, which weakens the synapse.
- Presynaptic action potentials that occur within 1 to 2 minutes after the end of the tetanus release more neurotransmitter due to post-tetanic potentiation.
