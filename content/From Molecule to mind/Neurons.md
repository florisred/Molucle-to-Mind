# What makes a neuron?
## Basics
- Specialized for long-distance communication
- Does this with *axons* and *dendrites*
	- Form *dendritic branches*
		- Are the *input*
		- The amount of inputs depends on the complexity of *dendritic arbor*
			- The more inputs, the higher the *convergence*
				- Can range from 1-100,000
		- Have a lot of *ribosomes*
	- Only *one* axon
		- The amount of targets this axon has, represents the *divergence*
- Axons and Dendrites connect at specialized sites, the *presynaptic* and*postsynaptic* regions. 
	- Communication is not direct, but done with molecules called *neurotransmitters*
		- Travel through the *synaptic cleft*
## Types of neurons
- Neurons with short axons are called *local circuit neurons*, or *interneurons*
- Neurons with long axons are called *projection neurons*
# [[Action potentials]]
- Neurons convey information using *action potentials*
	- All-or-nothing changes in the electrical potential (voltage) across cell membrane
	- From cell to cell these are called *synaptic transmission*
		- Often at *chemical synapses*
			- Done with chemicals in *synaptic vesicles* which release *neurotransmitters*
		- Sometimes at *electrical synapses* (rare in adult CNS)
