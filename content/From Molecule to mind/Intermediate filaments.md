## What are Intermediate filaments?
- *Intermediate filaments* have great *tensile strength* 
	- Their main function is to withstand great mechanical stress the cell endures
	- Called intermediate filaments because they were discovered in muscle cells, along smaller and bigger types of filament
	- Are the strongest filament we know 
- They form a network throughout the cell, spanning from nucleus to plasma membrane
	- Even inside the nucleus, where they form the *nuclear lamina*
	- They even connect to other cells at *desmosomes*
## intermediate filaments are strong and ropelike
- They are like a rope in which many long strands are twisted together to get strength
	- Made of *intermediate filament proteins*, a fibrous *subdomain* that has a *central elongated rod domain* with unstructured domains at each end 
	- Rod domain is made of *extended Î±-helical region* that can wrap around each other
		- Two of those running in opposite directions, and then combine another few times to form the final 'rope* [[like this]]
	- Since they run against each other, both ends are the same
- All interactions with the intermediate filaments depend on *noncovalent bonding*
	- Combined strength!
- The central rods are all the same, the outside domains are all different!
	- Outside domains allow the intermediate filaments to interact with other parts of the cell
## Intermediate filaments strengthen cells against mechanical stress
- They are most common in cells that undergo a lot of mechanical stress
	- in *axons*, *muscle*, and *skin cells*
	- They do this by *distributing* more gracefully
- *Four* classes of intermediate filaments
	1. *Keratin filaments* in skin (epithelial) cells
	2. *Vimentin & vimentin related cells* in connective tissue, muscle, and *glial cells*
	3. *neurofilaments* in nerve cells
	4. *Nuclear lamins* that strenghten the [[Nuclear envelope]]
### Keratin filaments
- most diverse -> every epithelial tissue has its own mix of keratins
	- Also hair, feathers, etc.
- Often span the entire length of the cell, and are connected through *desmosomes*
- An example of what happens when they dont work correctly is *epidermolysis bullosa simplex*, where skin blisters and ruptures easily due to defects in the keratin gene
- Many filaments are stabilized by other proteins called *plectin*
### Nuclear lamina
- The nuclear envelope is strengthened by the nuclear lamina, formed out of *nuclear lamins*
	- Disassembles and reforms during each cell devision
		- Controlled by *(de)phosphorylation* of the lamina by protein kinases
- Defects in the nuclear lamina lead to a rare disease called *progeria*, where individuals age faster and in their teens develop wrinkled skin and cardiovascular diseases
