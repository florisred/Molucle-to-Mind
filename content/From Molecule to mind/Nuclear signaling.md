## Nuclear signaling
- the [[kinase]] promotes new RNA synthesis -> can take like 30-60 mins, very slow.
- First signaled by *transcription factors* which is transcriptional activator protein
	- Change the [[The regulation of Chromosome Structure#Interphase Chromosomes Contain Both Condensed and more extended Forms of Chromatin|chromatin]] structure allowing transcription of DNA
	- Also bind to proteins that *unwrap* the DNA
	- Can also change the *RNA polymerase* to promote transcription
	- this allows the [[From DNA to RNA#Promotor & terminator|promoter]] to bind to the DNA, starting transcription and then translation
- Three *activator proteins* regulating gene expression:
### CREB - The cAMP response element binding protein
- *[[CREB]]* is typically bound to its binding site on DNA
- In unstimulated cells, the CREB is very inactive
- But, multiple pathways can activate it by *phosphorylating* it
	- [[Second messengers#Protein kinases|PKA]], *RAS*, and *calmodulin*
	- Example of [[Neurons|convergence]]!
- CREB has been implicated in *spatial learning*, *behavioral sensitization*, *long-term memory of odorant-conditioned behavior*, and *long-term synaptic plasticity*
### Nuclear receptors
- Recept membrane-permeant ligands. [[Signalling strategies#Cell-permeant|earlier context i think]]
- Are also *transcription factors*
- For example: *glucocorticoid hormone receptors* 
	- When inactive, they are in the cytoplasm, when active, move to nucleus
	- Can then bind to DNA to work as a transcription factor
- Some others  permanently bind to DNA and can work as a switch from inhibitor to promotor
### C-fos
- is an *immediate early gene* -> its synthesis is directly triggered by the stimulus
- once synthesized, c-fos protein can act as a *transcriptional activator* to induce synthesis of second-order genes. These are termed delayed response genes because their activity is delayed by the fact that an immediate early gene must be activated first.
