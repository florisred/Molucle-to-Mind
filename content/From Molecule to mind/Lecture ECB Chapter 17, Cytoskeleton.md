# Components of cytoskeleton
- Intermediary filaments
	- Ropelike fibres with diameter of 10nm
	- meshwork called nuclear lamina
	- gives mechanical strength
- Microtubules
	- Long, hollow cylinders diameter *25nm*
	- made of *tubulin*
	- often bound to *centrosome*
- Actin filaments
	- *also called microfilaments*
	- Helical polymers of *actin*
	- flexible, diameter *7nm*
## Intermediary Filaments
- Built from monomers -> amino and carboxyl group wich can attach to one another and forms dimers / tetramers
- Helps give cells the ability to stretch, so they don't rupture
	- Gives strength to *nuclear membrane*
	- Done by meshwork of intermediary filaments in the nucleus called *nuclear envelope*

## [[Microtubules]]
- Play different roles
- They grow from the *centrosome* or basal bodies. 
	- Cell division starts with the division of the *centrosome* and *nuclei*
- Also present in a *ciliated cell*
	- Then originate form *basal bodies*
- *Tubulin heterodimers* are the subunits of microtubules
	- They grow from the top with altering alpha & beta subunits
	- *Lumen* = inside, but nothing goes through
	- *Protofilament* is a single line of tubulin heterodimer -> does not actually exist in real life, mostly for us to grasp it better.
- *Centrosomes* consist of *gamma-tubulin* rings. 
	- From there microtubules can grow
### How do microtubules grow?
- Growing starts at the *+ end* (not electric charge, just for us)
- Tubulin heterodimers are *bound with GTP*
	- These *GTP-caps* stabalize the tubule
		- If it *hydrolyses* (GTP TO GDP), it is *destabilized*
	- Then, GDP tubulin is released back to the cytosol
		- The *microtubules* are shrunk then. 
	- This happens *enzymatically*, and therefore we need another stabilizer  other than *GTP-caps*
- *Capping proteins* sit on the cell membrane or organelle
	- If a microtubule reaches it, it stabilizes it permanently
- This is very wasteful, but this is the cell fighting against the *second law of thermodynamics* --> always fighting against chaos

### Motor proteins
- Drive transport in a neuron along *microtubules*
	- They 'walk' along it, transporting cargo
		- can be anything that can connect via adaptor protein
- Can walk from + to - and from - to +
	- Using *kinesin heads* to attach to the tubules
- They are able to pull very large things like *organelles* or even *silica beads* (in experiments)
- Done y the *kinesine motor-protein*
	- Two 'shoes' -> one binds to the tubule, releases ADP, takes in ATP, makes conformational change --> throws other shoe forwards, releases ADP, binds ATP, conformational change
		- etc
	- Costs a lot of ATP.
## Actin filaments
- Often found *beneath* the cell membrane
	- Can be seen during cell growth, or to divide cells (with rings)
- Built from monomers --> same molecule the entire time
	- contrasts with *microtubules*
	- However, there is directionality due to the *contact sites* not being the same --> [[Figure actin directionality]]
		- + end is again the growing end
- Actin is again stabilized by bound *ATP*
	- ATP binds to actin, changes formation, changes affinity
		- Now want to bind with other actin molecules
	- When ATP *hydrolyzes* the actin is destabilized again
- Many different proteins regulate actin in the cytoskeleton
- In the cell, actin is very *dynamic*
	- growing / shrinking all the time
	- play a role in *cell movement* --> [[Cell movement actin figure]]
		- Have actin beneath the cell membrane
		- The actin will grow at the *leading edge* 
			- Pushes forward the cell membrane
		- On the back end, there is *contraction*
			- *actin broken down*
- *[[Leading edge]]*
	- A cell that *grows in one direction* protrudes its membrane
	- *lamellipodium* = the actin that pushes the cell forward
	- ARP complex binds to the actin, and creates a new actin line
	- At the other side, it breaks down
- *Myosin* is a motor protein involved in transport along the actin filaments
	- It binds to proteins anchored in the cell membrane, so when *myosin* starts transporting, it pushes or pulls the *cytoskeleton*
