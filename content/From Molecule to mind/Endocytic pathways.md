## What is endocytosis?
- *Endocytosis*: *Eukaryotic cells* constantly take up water & molecules
	- Happens by budding off small vesicles of the *plasma membrane* and transporting them to *endosomes* -> to *lysosomes* for digestion
- Two types of *endocytosis*: 
	- **Pinocytosis**: cellular *drinking*, using small vesicles
	- **Phagocytosis**: cellular *eating*, using large vesicles
## specialized phagocytic cells ingest large particles
  - Phagocytic cells are the most dramatic example of *endocytosis*, but they are relatively uncommon
  - We see them in the gut, but also in white blood cells to defend against infection
	  - By 'eating' the infection and sending it directly to the *lysosome*, they kill the infection
	  - For this, they first have to be bound to the outside of the plasma membrane
		  - This happens due to receptor proteins on the cell membrane -> antibody receptors
			- Can cause problems too, in the case of *TB*, where the bacterium is ingested, but it prevents the *phagosome* to fuse with the *lysosome*, so the bacterium survives and multiplies -> bad for you
- *Phagocytic* cells also play a role in filtering out worn out blood cells
## Fluid and macromolecules are taken up by pinocytosis
- *Pinocytosis*: the process of re-uptaking some plasma membrane, together with a little bit of extracellular fluid
	- Can be surprisingly much, a macrophage swallows 3% of its plasma membrane every minute, and ingests 25% of its own volume in an hour
	- But, this heavily depends on cell type
- This process is *indiscriminate*, and therefore there is no real control of what gets in
- Also done by the [[Vesicular transport#vesicle budding is driven by the assembly of a protein coat|coated cells]]
## receptor-mediated endocytosis provides a specific route into animal cells
- *receptor-mediated endocytosis*: A receptor on the cell surface encounters a specific molecule that needs to be ingested, and causes it to be put in a vesicle to inside the cell
	- Increases the efficiency of internalization of particular macromolecules more than 1000-fold
		- So a cell can take up a lot of substance without a lot of extracellular fluid
- Animals use this to take up the *cholesterol* for plasma membrane
	- *cholesterol* is very insoluble, so is taken up by *LDL* (low-density lipoprotein), which is sensed by the cellular receptors -> after being ingested, LDL goes into the lysosome, where it dissociates from the receptor-complex due to the *acidic* environment. 
		- The LDL releases the cholesterol, which escapes into the cytosol
- [[Cholesterol pathway]]
## endocytosed macromolecules are sorted in endosomes
- Most material absorbed is brought to *endosomes* -> you can visualize these with electron microscopes 
	- Then you can see that the endosome is a lot of tubes and vesicles, complexly tied together
	- Marker molecules first end up in *early endosomes* near the plasma membrane
		- 5-15 minutes later in the *late endosomes* 
			- Early endosomes mature gradually into late endosomes
		- The inside of the endosome is kept acidic with an ATP-bound H<sup>+</sup> pump
			- This causes the release of receptor-protein complexes, after which receptors are often brought back to the plasma membrane or destroyed by lysosomes
- It is kind of analogous to the trans golgi network [[Secretory Pathways#proteins are Further modified and sorted in the golgi apparatus|explained here]], but inward instead of outward
	- It sorts the molecules for where they need to go
- Endosomes mature into lysosomes, so they can digest big cargo proteins
### Lysosomes are the principal sites of intracellular digestion
- Extracellular particles often end up in the lysosome for digestion
	- *Sacs* that contain about 40 types of *hydrolytic enzymes* active in acidic conditions, such that if they spill into the cytosol they do not destroy proteins 
- Lysosomal membrane is special:
	- *lysosomal membrane* contains *transporters* allowing final products of the digestion of macromolecules to be sent to the cytosol
- *autophagy*: degrading old/obsolete parts of the cell
	- Begins with enclosure of the organelle by *autophagosome*, which fuses with the lysosome
	-
