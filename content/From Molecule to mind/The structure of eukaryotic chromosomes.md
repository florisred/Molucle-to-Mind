## The structure of Eukaryotic chromosomes
- Each human cell contains about 2 meters of DNA, but *nucleus* is only 5–8 μm in diameter
	- Like folding 40km of a tiny string into a tennis ball
- This is done by packaging the DNA strands into chromosomes
- In bacteria, the prokaryotic DNA is a circle, which we also (erroneously) call a chromosome
	- Less is know about this, so we focus on eukaryotic cells
### Multiple chromosomes
- Humans have .2 × 109 nucleotides parceled out into 23 or 24 different types of chromosome
	- *Males* have the Y chromosome that *females* do not have, hence the difference
- The complex of DNA and protein is called *chromatin*
- Humans have two copies of each chromosome, one from dad and one form mom
	- These are the *homologous chromosomes (homologs)*
	- The only *nonhomologous chromosomes* are the X and Y chromosomes.
	- Most chromosomes are different sizes
	- *DNA hybridization*: Adding fluorescent dyes so different chromosomes can be distinguished
	- *Karyotype*: Full set of 46 chromosomes
### What do chromosomes do?
- They carry the *genes* --> genetic code for [[Chapter 4 Cell Biology, Protein Structure and Function|proteins]]
	- [[Genes on the DNA of yeast]]
	- Most *genes* carry the code for *RNA molecules* that then go on to produce *proteins*
- *Genome*: all of the genetic code of an organism
	- A lot of the genome does not code for genes or proteins --> *junk DNA*
		- Misnomer: we do not know what it does yet, does not mean it is junk
			- A lot of it is preserved in related species, so it must be useful
- In general, more complex organism -> more complex DNA, [[example table of this]]
	- Does not always hold, especially for amount of chromosomes
### Specialized DNA Sequences Are Required for DNA Replication and Chromosome Segregation
- For an organism to function, it must be able to replicate its DNA and sort the chromosomes into the two daughter cells well. 
	- This is done in an ordered sequence of events, called the *[[Cell cycle]]*
	- In this chapter, we only focus on the *interphase* (when chromosomes are duplicated) and *mitosis* (when the cell splits)
#### Interphase
- Chromosomes are *extended* into straight thin lines and duplicated --> *interphase chromosomes*
- One *nucleotide sequence* acts as the *replication origin* (at many places for rapid copying)
- Another DNA sequence forms the *telomeres* at each of the two ends of a chromosome
- *Centromere*: A nucleotide sequence that tells the cell where to put the *mitotic spindles*
	- They are attached after the chromosomes have duplicated and compacted themselves into *mitotic chromosomes* --> most easily visible under microscope
#### Interphase Chromosomes Are Not Randomly Distributed Within the Nucleus
- Each chromosome is in a specific part of the nucleus so it does not become entangled
	- Can also be attached to the *nuclear envelope* (concentric membranes that surround the nucleus) or *nuclear lamina* (the protein meshwork that supports the envelope)
- *Nucleolus*: where parts of the *chromosome* cluster together that encode *ribosomal RNAs*
#### The DNA in Chromosomes is Always highly Condensed
- DNA condensing is done by proteins that *coil* the DNA tightly
- Still, chromosomes must be dynamic to allow for copying and rapid access when cell lives
#### Nucleosomes Are the Basic Units of eukaryotic Chromosome Structure
- Proteins that *bind to the DNA* to make them into *chromosomes* can be divided into two classes:
	1. *Histones*
		- present in enormous quantities (60 million in each cell or sm, its crazy)
		- Mass is about equal to the mass of the DNA
	2. *nonhistone chromosomal proteins*
- These two are together called *chromatin*
##### Nucleosome
- Histones form the *nucleosome*, the first and most fundamental level of chromatin packing
- When breaking up a cell in the *interphase*, most chromatin is in the form of *chromatin fibers*
	- Can be seen as a series of *[[beads on a string]]* 
	- An *individual nucleosome core particle* consists of a complex of *eight histone proteins*—two molecules each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4—and a stretch of *double-stranded DNA* winding around this *histone* --> we call this a *histone octomer*
- Formation of nucleosomes converts a *DNA molecule into a chromatin thread* that is approximately *one-third the length* of the initial piece of DNA, and it provides the first level of DNA packing
	- I know this makes no sense, but look at [[histones & coiling|this]] and see how it coils, kinda makes sense.
	- Held together by positive charges that attach to the DNA sugars
- These *histones* are very well preserved in evolutionary history --> only two differences between H4 between cows and peas --> they are *vital!*
